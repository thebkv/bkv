# Song of Solomon 7 — BKV–NR (Symbolics Highlighted)  
### *The Restored Soul, Celebrated by the Beloved*

---

## **1–2 — The Dance of Restoration**
“How beautiful are your **steps** — your **walk** in harmony with God.
Your **legs** are like a craftsman’s work: **stability**, **strength**,
a foundation carved with intention.”

The soul’s walk has changed.
She no longer stumbles under guilt or shame.
Her movements are confident —
the dance of a healed spirit.

Her **inner center** — the **navel** — once hollow,
is now like a **goblet of wine**:
**joy** rising from the deep places.

---

## **3–4 — Affections and the Will Reordered**
Her **breasts** — the **affections** —
stand balanced, purified, whole.

Her **neck** — the **will** —
is a **tower** of dignity and strength.
She no longer bends to lesser desires.
She has an elevated perspective.

Her **eyes** — **inner vision** —
shine with clarity and peace.

---

## **5 — The Crown of Identity**
Her **head** is lifted like **Carmel** —
a peak of **identity restored** and **majesty regained**.

Her **hair**, her **visible glory**,
falls like royal tapestry.
The soul that once hid in shadows
now shines openly.

---

## **6 — The Beloved’s Delight**
“How fair, how pleasant you are.”
The Beloved delights not in perfection
but in **transformation** —
in what grace has made her become.

---

## **7–8 — The Tree of Life Within**
“You stand tall like a **palm tree** —
a symbol of **fruitfulness** and **uprightness**.
Your **clusters** are sweet —
the **fruit of the Spirit** manifesting in your life.”

The Beloved embraces her growth
and rejoices in what she now carries.

---

## **9 — The Wine of Speech**
“Your **words** are like the **finest wine** —
they bring **peace**, **comfort**, and **healing**.”

Grace has softened her tongue.
Her speech is now gentle and full of life.

---

## **10 — Mature Identity**
She answers:
“I am my Beloved’s,
and His **desire** — His **loving intention** — is toward me.”

This is mature faith.
No fear.
No striving.
Just belonging.

---

## **11–12 — The Shared Walk**
“Come, my Beloved. Let us walk in the **fields**
and examine the **vineyards**.”

The **fields** = the **ordinary moments** of life.
The **vineyards** = the **soul’s growth**, the **inner garden**.

This is partnership.
The disciple now invites the Spirit
into *every* part of life — not just the sacred hours.

---

## **13 — The Fragrance of Desire Redeemed**
The **mandrakes** — the **deep desires** — give off fragrance.
Old longings and new longings
blend together and rise toward the Beloved.

Everything in her —
past desires, future hopes,
ancient yearning, fresh devotion —
is opened to Him.

All is fragrance.
All is worship.
