# Song of Solomon 7 — BKV–NR (Symbolics Highlighted)  
### *The Restored Soul, Celebrated by the Beloved*

---

## **1–2 — The Dance of Restoration**  
“How beautiful are your **steps** — your **walk** in harmony with God.  
Your **legs** are like a craftsman’s work: **stability**, **strength**,  
a foundation carved with intention.”

The soul’s walk has changed.  
She no longer stumbles under guilt or shame.  
Her movements are confident —  
the dance of a healed spirit.

Her **inner center** — the **navel** — once hollow,  
is now like a **goblet of wine**:  
**joy** rising from the deep places.

---

## **3–4 — Affections and the Will Reordered**  
Her **breasts** — the **affections** —  
stand balanced, purified, whole.

Her **neck** — the **will** —  
is a **tower** of dignity and strength.  
She no longer bends to lesser desires.  
She has an elevated perspective.

Her **eyes** — **inner vision** —  
shine with clarity and peace.

---

## **5 — The Crown of Identity**  
Her **head** is lifted like **Carmel** —  
a peak of **identity restored** and **majesty regained**.

Her **hair**, her **visible glory**,  
falls like royal tapestry.  
The soul that once hid in shadows  
now shines openly.

---

## **6 — The Beloved’s Delight**  
“How fair, how pleasant you are.”  
The Beloved delights not in perfection  
but in **transformation** —  
in what grace has made her become.

---

## **7–8 — The Tree of Life Within**  
“You stand tall like a **palm tree** —  
a symbol of **fruitfulness** and **uprightness**.  
Your **clusters** are sweet —  
the **fruit of the Spirit** manifesting in your life.”

The Beloved embraces her growth  
and rejoices in what she now carries.

---

## **9 — The Wine of Speech**  
“Your **words** are like the **finest wine** —  
they bring **peace**, **comfort**, and **healing**.”

Grace has softened her tongue.  
Her speech is now gentle and full of life.

---

## **10 — Mature Identity**  
She answers:  
“I am my Beloved’s,  
and His **desire** — His **loving intention** — is toward me.”

This is mature faith.  
No fear.  
No striving.  
Just belonging.

---

## **11–12 — The Shared Walk**  
“Come, my Beloved. Let us walk in the **fields**  
and examine the **vineyards**.”

The **fields** = the **ordinary moments** of life.  
The **vineyards** = the **soul’s growth**, the **inner garden**.

This is partnership.  
The disciple now invites the Spirit  
into *every* part of life — not just the sacred hours.

---

## **13 — The Fragrance of Desire Redeemed**  
The **mandrakes** — the **deep desires** — give off fragrance.  
Old longings and new longings  
blend together and rise toward the Beloved.  

Everything in her —  
past desires, future hopes,  
ancient yearning, fresh devotion —  
is opened to Him.

All is fragrance.  
All is worship.
