# Song of Solomon 7 — BKV–NR. 
### *The Restored Soul, Celebrated by the Beloved*

> *This chapter is the awakened soul seen through the eyes of the Lord — the Spirit celebrating what grace has rebuilt.*

---

## **1–2 — The Dance of Restoration**  
The Beloved beholds her and says:  
“How beautiful are your steps as you move in harmony.  
Your inward strength is like a seasoned craftsman’s work —  
stable, carved, intentional.”

The soul’s walk has changed.  
She no longer stumbles under guilt or shame.  
Her movements are confident —  
the dance of someone healed from within.

Her inner life, once hollow, is now like  
a goblet overflowing with new wine —  
the joy of the Spirit rising from the deep places.

---

## **3–4 — Affection for the Renewed Heart**  
Her affections — once divided —  
now stand balanced and pure.

Her neck — the symbol of will —  
is like a tower built with purpose and dignity again.  
She no longer bends to lesser things.  
Her choices are upright.  
Her perspective is elevated.

Her eyes — inner vision — shine with unity and peace.

---

## **5 — The Radiant Crown**  
Her head is lifted like Carmel —  
a picture of majesty and restored identity.

Her hair falls like royal tapestry —  
a sign of glory reclaimed.  
The soul that once hid in shadows  
now shines openly, boldly.

---

## **6 — The Lover’s Delight**  
“How fair, how pleasant you are.”  
The Beloved delights not in perfection,  
but in transformation —  
in what grace has made her become.

---

## **7–8 — The Tree of Life Within**  
“You stand tall like a palm; your soul bears clusters of sweetness.”

This is the fruit the Vine-Dresser has been cultivating:  
patience, gentleness, strength, peace.  
The Beloved embraces her,  
rejoicing in the fruit she now carries.

---

## **9 — The Breath of Love**  
“Your words are like the finest wine.”  
When the soul speaks in alignment,  
her voice brings peace —  
it comforts, restores, and unites.

Grace makes the tongue gentle  
and the speech healing.

---

## **10 — A Mature Identity**  
And the soul answers:  
“I am my Beloved’s, and His desire is toward me.”

This is mature faith.  
No fear.  
No bargaining.  
No striving.  
Just belonging.

---

## **11–12 — The Walk into the Fields**  
“Come, my Beloved. Let us walk in the fields.  
Let us rise early and examine the vineyards.”

This is the life of partnership.  
The soul now invites the Spirit  
into every part of daily life —  
not just the temple moments,  
but the fields, the vineyards,  
the ordinary hours.

---

## **13 — The Fragrance of the Inner Garden**  
Old desires and new desires now work together.  
Everything in the soul — from the ancient longings  
to the fresh stirrings of grace —  
is opened and offered to the Beloved.

All is fragrance.  
All is devotion.
