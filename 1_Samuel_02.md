# 1 SAMUEL 02 — Bible Key Version (BKV)
## **Grace Interprets the World: The Song of Spiritual Reversal**

> _“The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.”_  
> — **1 Samuel 2:6 (KJV)**

## SUMMARY

Hannah’s Song is not a celebration of personal success.  
It is a **revelatory hymn** — Grace speaking after surrender has reordered perception.

What began as private grief in Chapter 1 now becomes a universal vision in Chapter 2.  
Hannah no longer speaks about *herself*; she speaks about **how reality works**.

The song reveals a consistent spiritual law:  
**self-exalting strength collapses, and receptive humility is established**.

This is the interpretive lens for all that follows in Samuel — Saul, David, the rise and fall of kings.  
Before a single king appears, Grace explains the rules of the kingdom.

# I. NATURAL READING (NR)

Hannah prays a song of praise to the LORD.  
She rejoices in God’s strength and declares that there is none holy like the LORD.  
She warns against pride and arrogance, saying that God weighs actions.

She describes a great reversal:  
the mighty are broken,  
the hungry are filled,  
the barren bear children,  
and those who were full become empty.

She declares that the LORD governs life and death, poverty and wealth, humility and exaltation.  
The song ends by affirming that God will judge the ends of the earth and strengthen His anointed.

The chapter then briefly returns to narrative, contrasting Samuel’s quiet service with the corruption of Eli’s sons.

# II. DEEP READING (DR)

Hannah now speaks as **Grace with vision**.

What was barren has become interpretive authority.

### **Reversal as Spiritual Law**
The song is structured around reversals, not as punishment, but as **rebalancing**:
- Egoic strength collapses under its own weight.
- Receptive humility is stabilized and lifted.

### **The Barren Bearing Seven**
“Seven” is not arithmetic.  
It is **completeness**.

Grace does not merely produce one outcome; it produces *ordered fullness*.  
This confirms that Hannah is not a motherhood symbol alone, but a **spiritual faculty** that generates wholeness.

### **Life and Death Language**
“Killeth and maketh alive” describes **ego death and spiritual awakening**, not violence.  
The false self must dissolve for the true self to rise.

### **Kingship Foreshadowed**
Before Saul is chosen, Hannah names the law that will judge him.  
Before David appears, Hannah describes the posture that will sustain him.

The song is **prophetic architecture**, not emotional overflow.

# III. COMMENTARY

Hannah’s Song answers a crucial question:

**What happens to the soul after surrender?**

It begins to see clearly.

Grace does not remain passive.  
Once it is aligned, it becomes *interpretive* — able to discern pride, humility, strength, weakness, and timing.

This is why Hannah can speak about the mighty and the weak without bitterness.  
She is no longer comparing herself to Peninnah.  
Comparison has died.

The song dismantles every system built on self-exaltation:
- pride of strength  
- pride of productivity  
- pride of certainty  

And it establishes a different axis:
- humility  
- dependence  
- receptivity  

This chapter also quietly exposes false religion.  
Immediately after the song, the text turns to **Hophni and Phinehas** — force and speech without illumination — showing what happens when religious authority operates without listening.

Hannah’s voice and Eli’s sons are placed side by side intentionally.  
One sings from alignment.  
The others act from corruption.
