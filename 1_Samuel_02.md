### **I. The Song of Grace (vv 1–10)**

Hannah prayed and said:
> “My heart rejoiceth in the Source; my horn is exalted in the Source.”

*The soul that once wept now sings. Her ‘horn’ — symbol of power — is the strength of **inner exaltation** rising from Grace.*

She declares:
> “There is none holy as the Source: for there is none beside thee.”

The song is the first great canticle of **Reversal**: the law by which the humble are raised and the proud brought low.

- **The bows of the mighty are broken,** and they that stumbled are girded with strength.
- **They that were full hire themselves for bread,** and they that were hungry cease.
- **The barren hath borne seven,** and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.

*Each line reverses an appearance — poverty turns to riches, weakness to power, barrenness to fruitfulness — for these conditions are **states of consciousness**, not of circumstance.*

“The Source killeth and maketh alive; He bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up.”
*Death and life are shown as **movements of awareness** — the dying of **self-dependence** and the rising of **divine identity**.*

“The pillars of the earth are the Source’s, and He hath set the world upon them.”
*The ‘pillars’ represent **unalterable spiritual laws** supporting manifest order.*

The song closes with a prophecy beyond its own age:
> “He shall give strength unto His King, and exalt the horn of His Anointed.”
*The **inner Messiah** — the **Anointed Consciousness** — is foretold within the voice of Grace.*

### **II. Transition to Service (vv 11–21)**

Elkanah returned to Ramah, but **Samuel (Heard of God)** ministered before the Source under **Eli (Uplifted Awareness)**.
Each year Hannah brought a **little coat** to the child she had lent to the Source.

*This garment symbolizes **progressive unfoldment** — each year the spirit receives a new **vesture of understanding**.*

The Source remembered Hannah; she bore three sons and two daughters.
*Grace that once seemed barren becomes **abundantly creative** when desire is dedicated to service.*

### **III. The Corruption of Eli’s Sons (vv 12–26)**

The sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the Source.
*Awareness that becomes **self-indulgent** — living on the outer forms of worship — loses its reverence and pollutes the sanctuary.*

They took by force the portion of the sacrifice, symbol of **appropriating spiritual energy for personal gain**.

But **Samuel grew** — he ministered before the Source as a child, girded with a linen ephod.
*The newly born faculty of **Prophetic Intuition** matures quietly even while the old order decays.*

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Samuel 2** reveals the law of **Spiritual Reversal** — the power by which **inner Grace** overturns outer hierarchy.

- The Song of Hannah is the voice of the **Soul** rejoicing in the collapse of false strength.
- The barren becomes fruitful when desire is **purified of self-claim**.
- The **Anointed (Christ Principle)** emerges within as a new center of governance.
- **Eli’s sons** typify the old religious faculties — knowledge without life — that must pass away.
- **Samuel** represents the **child of Revelation** growing amid corruption, untainted because his service is **pure attention**.

## **Addendum — The Law of Reversal**

Every advance of the soul follows a **reversal**:
what was exalted in the ego is brought low, and what was despised in humility is raised.
This is not punishment but **balance** — the soul discovering its true center of power.

The song of Grace is the first whisper of the Messianic law within man:
> *Strength is perfected in weakness, and life is born through surrender.*

---

## **Core BKV Principle — 1 Samuel 2**

> **When Grace rejoices in its own humbling, the law of Reversal is fulfilled: the strong are unseated, the barren become fruitful, and the new prophetic voice is born within.**
