## **Prelude**

Having received the divine mandate, the **Principle of Divine Realization (Joshua)** does not act impulsively. Every movement of realization must begin with **awareness**. Thus, the inner work of possession begins with **investigation** — the discerning of what still resists transformation.

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

1. Then the **Principle of Divine Realization (Joshua)**, the active faculty of the **Principle of Divine Law (Moses)**, sent out two **Principles of Scrutiny (spies)** secretly from the **State of Renewal (Shittim)**, saying, “Go view the **Realized State of Consciousness**, especially the stronghold of **Entrenched Egoic Habits (Jericho)**.” So they went and came into the house of a **Receptive Principle (Rahab)**, and lodged there.
2. And it was told to the **Governing Faculty of Entrenched Habits (King of Jericho)**, “Behold, principles of consciousness have come in here tonight from the **Aspects of the Soul (Israel)** to search out the **Inner Domain**.”
3. Then the **Governing Faculty** sent to the **Receptive Principle**, saying, “Bring out the **Principles of Scrutiny** that have come to you, which have entered your house, for they have come to search out all the **Inner Domain**.”
4. But the **Receptive Principle** had taken the two **Principles of Scrutiny** and hidden them. And she said, “Truly, the principles came to me, but I did not know where they were from.
5. And when the **Principles of Opposition** were going out, about the time of the shutting of the **gates of the conscious mind**, the principles of consciousness went out. I do not know where they went; pursue them quickly, for you may overtake them.”
6. But she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them with the **Fibres of Concealment (stalks of flax)** — **the humble, ordinary thoughts that veil the dawning truth until it is safe to reveal.**
9. And she said to the **Principles of Scrutiny**, “I know that the **Ultimate Reality** has given you the **Realized State of Consciousness**, and that **psychological terror** has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the **Inner Domain** melt away because of you.
10. For we have heard how the **Ultimate Reality** dried up the **Flow of Separation (Red Sea)** before you when you came out of the **State of Bondage (Egypt)**, and what you did to the two **Subdued Egoic States (Kings of the Amorites)** on the other side of the **Flow of Conscious Life (Jordan)**…
11. As soon as we heard these things, our **Inner Heart** did melt; neither did there remain any more **Principle of Courage** in any aspect of the self, because of you: for the **Ultimate Reality**, your **Source**, is the **Source** in **Spiritual Heaven** above, and in the **Inner Earth** beneath.
12. “Now therefore, please swear to me by the **Ultimate Reality**, since I have shown you **inner kindness**, that you also will show **inner kindness** to my **Faculties of Kinship**...
18. “Behold, when we come into the **Inner Domain**, you shall bind this **Sign of Salvation (line of scarlet thread)** in the window which you did let us down by; and you shall bring your **Faculties of Kinship** and all your **inner household** home unto you into the house.”
24. And they said to the **Principle of Divine Realization**, “Truly the **Ultimate Reality** has delivered all the **Inner Domain** into our hands; for even all the inhabitants of the **Inner Domain** are seized with **psychological terror** because of us.”

## **Commentary on the Action**

### **The Mission of Awareness**

Joshua 2 reveals the essential, preliminary inner action before the great spiritual leap: the **Principle of Divine Realization** sends **Principles of Scrutiny** to investigate the stronghold of **Entrenched Egoic Habits (Jericho)**.

This is not a mission of doubt, but of **precision** — to understand the structure of the internal opposition. **Before conquest can begin, there must be understanding.**

### **The Receptive Principle’s Choice**

The key interaction is with the **Receptive Principle (Rahab)**. Rahab represents the **redeemable faculty of the soul** dwelling within the stronghold of the ego. She is a principle of **spiritual openness** that has received the truth — **“I know that the Ultimate Reality has given you the Realized State of Consciousness”** (vv. 9–11) — and chooses alignment with the Higher Self.

### **The Hidden Work of Redemption**

By hiding the Principles of Scrutiny under the **Fibres of Concealment**, Rahab ensures that the necessary inner investigation can proceed without detection or compromise by the **Governing Faculty of Entrenched Habits**.

The **scarlet thread** bound in the **Window of Perception** is the central **BKV-NR symbol** of the chapter. The window is where the soul looks *out* at the world, and where the world looks *in* at the soul. Binding the **Scarlet Thread (Redemption / Compassion)** there ensures that the Rahab-Principle and its associated faculties are **marked by grace** and protected from the forthcoming inner purge. **Rahab’s act signifies that the lowest place of consciousness — the one once allied with ego — can become the entry point for grace.** Her redemption prefigures the **sanctification of perception itself.**

## **Interpretive Insights**

**I.1 The Role of Scrutiny**
The Principles of Scrutiny are the necessary **intellectual instruments of discernment**. Before the whole soul commits, the mind must use these faculties to observe the psychological terrain, **confirming that the internal opposition is already weakened by awe of the Divine.** The action is an act of **courageous fact-finding**, not of fear.

**I.2 Salvation of the Receptive Principle**
Rahab’s choice demonstrates that **spiritual alignment supersedes origin**. Though dwelling in the core of egoic opposition (Jericho), her **faculty of receptivity** and **knowledge of Divine Reality** are sufficient for salvation. She serves as the **spiritual intelligence** within the enemy territory, paving the way for conquest.

**I.3 The Sign of Protection (The Scarlet Thread)**
The scarlet thread bound in the **Window of Perception** symbolizes **Divine Remembrance** — a visible mark of grace ensuring that what is aligned with the Higher Self will be spared as the inner walls fall.

### **Closing Reflection**

Before the walls of Jericho fall, they are first understood.
The conquest of consciousness begins in the house of Rahab —
where grace finds a dwelling even within the enemy’s walls.
