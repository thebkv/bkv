# 1 Corinthians 11 — BKV Study  
### *Sacred Order, Symbolic Coverings, and the Lord’s Table*

---

# **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

### **Imitation and Order**

1. Be **imitators** of me,  
   as I also am of Christ.

2. I praise you, brothers,  
   that you remember me in all things  
   and hold the traditions  
   just as I delivered them.

3. But I want you to know  
   that the **head of every man is Christ**,  
   the **head of the woman is the man**,  
   and the **head of Christ is God**.

---

### **Symbolic Coverings**

4. Every man who prays or prophesies  
   having his head covered  
   dishonors his head.

5. But every woman who prays or prophesies  
   with her head uncovered  
   dishonors her head —  
   for that is one and the same  
   as if she were shaved.

6. For if a woman is not covered,  
   let her also be shorn;  
   but if it is shameful  
   to be shorn or shaved,  
   let her be covered.

7. For a man indeed  
   ought not to cover his head,  
   since he is the **image and glory of God**;  
   but the woman is the **glory of man**.

8. For man is not from woman,  
   but woman from man;

9. nor was man created for woman,  
   but woman for man.

10. For this reason,  
    and because of the angels,  
    the woman ought to have  
    **authority** on her head.

---

### **Mutuality and Origin**

11. Nevertheless,  
    in the Lord  
    woman is not independent of man,  
    nor man independent of woman.

12. For as woman came from man,  
    so also man is born through woman;  
    and all things are from God.

13. Judge among yourselves:  
    is it proper for a woman  
    to pray to God uncovered?

14. Does not even nature itself  
    teach you  
    that if a man has long hair  
    it is a dishonor to him?

15. But if a woman has long hair,  
    it is her glory;  
    for her long hair  
    is given to her as a **covering**.

16. But if anyone seems contentious,  
    we have no such custom,  
    nor do the assemblies of God.

# **The Lord’s Table**

### **Correction of Disorder**

17. But in the following instructions  
    I do not praise you,  
    because you come together  
    not for the better,  
    but for the worse.

18. For first of all,  
    when you come together as a church,  
    I hear there are **divisions** among you,  
    and in part I believe it.

19. For there must also be **factions**,  
    that those who are genuine  
    may be evident among you.

20. Therefore when you meet together,  
    it is not truly  
    to eat the Lord’s Supper.

21. For in eating,  
    each one takes his own supper ahead of others;  
    one is hungry,  
    and another is drunk.

22. What?  
    Do you not have houses  
    to eat and drink in?  
    Or do you despise  
    the assembly of God  
    and shame those who have nothing?

# **Paul’s Received Tradition**

23. For I received from the Lord  
    what I also delivered to you:  
    that the Lord Jesus,  
    on the night He was betrayed,  
    took bread;

24. and when He had given thanks,  
    He broke it and said,  
    **“This is My body,  
    which is for you;  
    do this in remembrance of Me.”**

25. In the same manner  
    He took the cup after supper, saying,  
    **“This cup is the new covenant in My blood.  
    Do this,  
    as often as you drink it,  
    in remembrance of Me.”**

26. For as often as you eat this bread  
    and drink this cup,  
    you proclaim the Lord’s death  
    until He comes.

---

### **Worthy Participation**

27. Therefore whoever eats this bread  
    or drinks this cup of the Lord  
    in an unworthy manner  
    will be guilty of the body  
    and blood of the Lord.

28. But let a person examine himself,  
    and so eat of the bread  
    and drink of the cup.

29. For he who eats and drinks  
    in an unworthy manner  
    eats and drinks judgment on himself,  
    not discerning  
    the Lord’s body.

30. For this reason  
    many are weak and sick among you,  
    and many sleep.

31. For if we would judge ourselves,  
    we would not be judged.

32. But when we are judged,  
    we are disciplined by the Lord,  
    that we may not be condemned  
    with the world.

---

### **Practical Order**

33. Therefore, my brothers,  
    when you come together to eat,  
    wait for one another.

34. But if anyone is hungry,  
    let him eat at home,  
    lest you come together for judgment.  
    The rest I will set in order  
    when I come.

# **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**  
### *Poetic Alignment*

- Headship  
  is sacred order,  
  not domination.

- Coverings  
  are symbols  
  of posture,  
  honor,  
  and authority.

- Man stands unveiled  
  as God’s image.  
  Woman stands veiled  
  as man’s glory —  
  a sign of unity,  
  origin,  
  and mutual interdependence.

- Yet in the Lord,  
  neither stands alone.

- Angels watch  
  the order of worship.

- The Table  
  demands discernment  
  and unity.  
  The bread unites.  
  The cup binds.  
  The meal proclaims.

- Disorder  
  turns communion  
  into judgment.

- But the examined heart  
  finds grace.

# **Summary / Commentary**

### **1. Sacred order is symbolic, not hierarchical.**  
Paul is not flattening men and women.  
He is mapping **origin**, **honor**, and **representation**:

- God → Christ → man → woman  
- Not as a chain of superiority  
- But as a **flow of life**

Each honors the one they symbolize.

### **2. Coverings are worship signs.**  
They are about *posture*, not control.  
They acknowledge relational origin and divine order.

### **3. The Lord’s Table requires unity.**  
The issue was:

- arrogance  
- impatience  
- shaming the poor  
- treating the gathering like a private feast  

Thus the Table became judgment instead of healing.

### **4. “Unworthy” = with contempt, not with imperfection.**  
Paul rebukes a **posture**, not a lack of holiness expertise.  
Eating unworthily = failing to discern:

- the unity of the body  
- the sacredness of the moment  
- Christ’s self-giving  

### **5. Examine, discern, receive.**  
Communion is a place of:

- remembrance  
- proclamation  
- participation  
- self-humbling  
- unity  
- healing  

When the heart aligns, the Table becomes life.
