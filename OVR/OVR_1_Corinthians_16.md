### *Final Instructions, Final Greetings, Final Admonition*

# **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

## **The Offering & the Travel Plan**

1. Concerning the **collection for the saints**,  
   as I directed the assemblies of Galatia,  
   so you also do.

2. On the **first day of the week**,  
   let each of you set something aside,  
   storing it up as he may prosper,  
   so that no collections need to be made when I come.

3. And when I arrive,  
   I will send those whom you approve  
   with letters to carry your gift  
   to **Jerusalem**.

4. And if it is fitting that I go also,  
   they will go with me.

5. Now I will come to you  
   when I pass through **Macedonia**,  
   for I am passing through Macedonia.

6. And perhaps I will remain with you,  
   or even spend the winter,  
   that you may send me on my way  
   wherever I go.

7. For I do not wish to see you now only in passing;  
   I hope to remain with you for a while,  
   **if the Lord permits**.

8. But I will remain at **Ephesus** until Pentecost.

9. For a **great and effective door** is opened to me,  
   and there are many **adversaries**.

## **Final Exhortations**

10. Now concerning **Timothy**:  
    If he comes,  
    see that he may be with you without fear;  
    for he does the work of the Lord  
    as I also do.

11. Let no one despise him.  
    Send him on his way in peace.

12. As for **Apollos**,  
    I strongly urged him to come to you with the brethren,  
    but he was unwilling to come at this time;  
    he will come when he has opportunity.

13. **Watch.  
    Stand fast in the faith.  
    Be brave.  
    Be strong.**

14. Let all that you do  
    be done in **love**.

## **Honor the Faithful Workers**

15. I urge you, brethren —  
    you know the household of **Stephanas**,  
    that it is the **firstfruits of Achaia**,  
    and that they have devoted themselves  
    to the service of the saints —

16. That you also submit to such people,  
    and to everyone who works  
    and labors with us.

17. I am glad for the coming of Stephanas,  
    Fortunatus,  
    and Achaicus;  
    for what was lacking on your part  
    they supplied.

18. For they refreshed my spirit  
    and yours.  
    Therefore acknowledge such men.

## **Final Greetings**

19. The assemblies of **Asia** greet you.  
    **Aquila and Priscilla** greet you warmly in the Lord,  
    with the assembly that meets in their house.

20. All the brethren greet you.  
    Greet one another  
    with a **holy kiss**.

21. The salutation of Paul  
    with my own hand.

22. If anyone does not love the Lord Jesus Christ,  
    let him be **anathema**.  
    **Maranatha**.

23. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ  
    be with you.

24. My love be with you all  
    in Christ Jesus.  
    Amen.

# **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**  
### *Poetic Alignment*

- Giving flows from love,  
  not pressure.

- Jerusalem receives;  
  Corinth learns generosity.

- Doors open;  
  adversaries rise.  
  Both are signs of calling.

- Timothy is young —  
  protect him.  
  Strength is not loudness;  
  courage is not spectacle.

- “Watch.  
   Stand fast.  
   Be brave.  
   Be strong.”  
  The fourfold posture of a steadfast soul.

- Love is the environment  
  in which all commands breathe.

- Honor the faithful.  
  The kingdom is carried  
  by quiet households  
  like Stephanas.

- Paul signs the letter  
  with his own hand —  
  a personal seal  
  on a turbulent church  
  he still loves.

# **Summary / Commentary**

### **1. Practical Love, Not Mysticism**  
The chapter grounds all the spiritual heights of chapter 15 in real life:  
giving, traveling, hosting, serving, protecting, honoring, greeting.

### **2. Paul organizes the churches relationally.**  
This chapter reveals the web of living connection:

- Corinth  
- Galatia  
- Macedonia  
- Asia  
- Jerusalem  
- Ephesus

The early church was a **network of mutual care**, not isolated nodes.

### **3. The call to courage is the heart of Corinth’s healing.**  
“Watch. Stand fast. Be brave. Be strong.”  
Paul is calling them out of immaturity and chaos into firmness, clarity, and unity.

### **4. “Let all that you do be done in love.”**  
This is the capstone.  
It ties the entire letter — gifts, divisions, immorality, lawsuits, worship, doctrine — into one command.

### **5. The ending is both tender and firm.**  
Paul gives a warning (**anathema**)  
and a cry (**Maranatha**)  
and then closes with love.
