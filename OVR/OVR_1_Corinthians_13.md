### *The More Excellent Way: Love as the Fulfillment of All Gifts*

---

# **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

1. Though I speak with the **tongues** of men and of angels,  
   but have not **love**,  
   I have become **sounding brass**  
   or a **clanging cymbal**.

2. And though I have the gift of **prophecy**,  
   and understand all **mysteries** and all **knowledge**,  
   and though I have all **faith**  
   so that I could remove mountains,  
   but have not **love**,  
   I am **nothing**.

3. And though I give all my goods to feed the poor,  
   and though I deliver my body to be burned,  
   but have not **love**,  
   it profits me **nothing**.

# **The Nature of Love**

4. **Love** is patient,  
   love is kind.  
   Love does not envy;  
   love does not boast;  
   love is not arrogant.

5. Love does not behave rudely;  
   does not seek its own;  
   is not provoked;  
   keeps no record of wrongs.

6. Love does not rejoice in unrighteousness,  
   but rejoices in the **truth**.

7. Love **bears all things**,  
   **believes all things**,  
   **hopes all things**,  
   **endures all things**.

8. **Love never fails.**

# **The Passing and the Permanent**

But whether there are **prophecies**,  
they will fail;

whether there are **tongues**,  
they will cease;

whether there is **knowledge**,  
it will vanish away.

9. For we know in part,  
   and we prophesy in part.

10. But when the **Perfect** comes,  
    that which is in part  
    will be done away.

11. When I was a child,  
    I spoke as a child,  
    understood as a child,  
    thought as a child;  
    but when I became a man,  
    I put away childish things.

12. For now we see  
    in a **mirror, dimly**,  
    but then **face to face**.  

    Now I know in part,  
    but then I shall know fully,  
    even as I am fully known.

# **The Triad of Permanence**

13. And now remain:  
    **faith**,  
    **hope**,  
    **love** —  
    these three;  

    but the greatest of these  
    is **love**.

# **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**  
### *Poetic Alignment*

- Gifts are **instruments**.  
  Love is the **music**.

- Knowledge is a **lamp**.  
  Love is the **sun**.

- Faith is the **hand** reaching.  
  Hope is the **heart** waiting.  
  Love is the **life** giving.

- Without love,  
  brilliance becomes noise.  
  Sacrifice becomes performance.  
  Power becomes nothing.

- Love:  
  suffers long,  
  refuses pride,  
  seeks no advantage,  
  forgives fully,  
  clings to truth,  
  holds until the end.

- Partial things fade.  
  Love remains.

- We see in fragments.  
  Love is the wholeness  
  waiting for us.

- We are known fully.  
  Love invites us to know  
  in that same fullness.

# **Summary / Commentary**

### **1. Love is the calibration of all gifts.**  
Without love, even the most dazzling spiritual abilities collapse into noise, ego, or emptiness.

### **2. Love is not emotion — it is posture.**  
Paul describes love in verbs, not feelings:

- patient  
- kind  
- humble  
- truth-seeking  
- resilient  
- enduring  

This is **will**, not sentiment.

### **3. Gifts fade; love abides.**  
Prophecy, tongues, knowledge —  
all are temporary strategies for the soul’s growth.

But love is the ultimate state.  
It is the architecture of the **Perfect**.

### **4. We are growing from fragment to fullness.**  
The mirror is dim now.  
But we are becoming the kind of beings  
who can see clearly —  
because we are becoming like the One who knows us fully.

### **5. The chapter is the bridge between 12 and 14.**  
It is not an isolated poem.  
It is Paul saying:

> “You want the higher gifts?  
>  Here is the highest one.”
