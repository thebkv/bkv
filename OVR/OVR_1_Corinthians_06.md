# 1 Corinthians 6 — BKV Study    
### *Inner Courts, Sacred Bodies, and the Authority of the Redeemed Mind*

---

## **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

### **Disputes Reveal Immaturity**

1. Dare any of you, having a dispute with another,  
   bring it before the **outer courts** rather than the **saints**?

2. Do you not know that the **saints shall judge the world**?  
   And if you will judge the world,  
   are you unfit to judge **trivial matters**?

3. Do you not know that we shall judge **angels**?  
   How much more the **things of this life**?

4. If you place judgment on everyday matters,  
   do you set those of **no standing** in the Assembly  
   to decide?

5. I say this to your shame.  
   Is there not among you a single one  
   wise enough to judge between brothers?

6. But instead, brother goes to law against brother —  
   and before **unbelievers**.

7. Already, then, this is a **defeat** among you:  
   that you have lawsuits at all.  
   Why not rather be **wronged**?  
   Why not rather be **defrauded**?

8. But instead you wrong and defraud —  
   even your own brothers.

### **Inheritance Requires Alignment**

9. Do you not know that the **unrighteous**  
   shall not inherit the **Kingdom of God**?  

   Do not be deceived —  
   neither the sexually immoral,  
   nor idolaters,  
   nor adulterers,  
   nor the effeminate,  
   nor those who corrupt themselves with mankind,

10. nor thieves,  
    nor the greedy,  
    nor drunkards,  
    nor revilers,  
    nor swindlers —  
    shall inherit the Kingdom of God.

11. **And such were some of you** —  
    but you were **washed**,  
    you were **sanctified**,  
    you were **justified**  
    in the name of the Lord Jesus,  
    and by the Spirit of our God.

### **The Body as Temple**

12. All things are lawful to me,  
    but not all things are beneficial.  
    All things are lawful,  
    but I will not be **mastered** by anything.

13. Food is for the belly, and the belly for food —  
    yet both will perish.  
    But the **body** is not for **immorality**,  
    but for the **Lord**,  
    and the Lord for the body.

14. And God has raised up the Lord,  
    and will also raise us up  
    by His power.

15. Do you not know  
    that your **bodies are members of Christ**?  
    Shall I then take the members of Christ  
    and make them members of a prostitute?  
    Never.

16. Do you not know  
    that the one joined to a prostitute  
    becomes one flesh with her?  
    “The two shall be one flesh.”

17. But the one who is joined to the **Lord**  
    is **one spirit**.

18. **Flee immorality.**  
    Every other sin occurs outside the body,  
    but the one committing immorality  
    sins against his **own body**.

19. Do you not know  
    that your body is the **Temple**  
    of the Holy Spirit within you,  
    whom you have from God —  
    and that you are **not your own**?

20. For you were **bought with a price**.  
    Therefore:  
    **glorify God in your body.**

# **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**  
### *A Poetic Mirror of the Chapter’s Inner Meaning*

- The courts of the world  
  cannot judge  
  what the awakened soul  
  must learn to judge within.

- Destiny requires dignity;  
  the one who will “judge angels”  
  must first learn  
  to arbitrate his own motives  
  and his own conflicts.

- The Kingdom is not inherited  
  by tendencies we refuse to confront;  
  the old list  
  is the old man —  
  and “such were some of you.”

- But you were washed.  
  You were set apart.  
  You were declared aligned.

- The body is not a burden —  
  it is a sanctuary.  
  Not an animal cage —  
  but a holy court  
  where the Spirit resides.

- The one who joins his body  
  to corruption  
  joins his soul to bondage.

- Flee immorality —  
  not out of fear,  
  but because you are a Temple  
  and Temples do not share walls  
  with idols.

- You were bought with a price;  
  live like you know the cost.

# **Summary / Commentary**

1 Corinthians 6 is one of the clearest statements in Scripture about:

### **1. The destiny and maturity of the believer.**  
“Judge the world”  
“Judge angels”  
“These small matters?”  
Paul is revealing the *future dignity* of the redeemed mind.

### **2. The necessity of inner judgment.**  
Lawsuits represent the refusal to take responsibility for one’s own motives and conflicts.

The Kingdom requires inward clarity.

### **3. The body as a sacred space.**  
Not a disposable shell,  
and not a neutral instrument —  
but a **Temple**,  
a vessel purchased with holy blood,  
designed to manifest glory.

### **4. Paul’s sexual ethic is not merely moral — it is architectural.**  
Immorality corrupts “one’s own body”  
because it corrupts  
the **Temple-structure** of the soul.

### **5. “You are not your own.”**  
The BKV absolutely must preserve this line —  
it is the antidote to the modern view  
that the self is a private possession  
rather than a sacred calling.

This chapter is an invitation to reclaim **dignity, clarity, and sacred embodiment**.
