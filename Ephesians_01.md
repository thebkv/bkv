| **The Divine Salutation** | **The Inner Address** |
| **1** — Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: | Paul, an **Emissary Appointed by Jesus Christ** by the intention of the **Source**, to the **Set-Apart Ones** in Ephesus, and to those **Aligned in Christ** — the ones rooted in His life and authority: |
| **2** — Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. | May **Grace** (Divine Gift) and **Peace** (Inner Rest) flow to you from **God our Father** and from **the Lord Jesus Christ**, the One through whom all blessing comes. |

| **The Divine Selection** | **The Design of the Soul** |
| **3** — Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ: | Blessed be the **Source and Father** of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has endowed us with **every spiritual resource** in the **higher realms of consciousness** available *in Christ*. |
| **4** — According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: | Just as He **chose** us **in Christ** before material history began, that we should be **whole**, **integrated**, and **unblemished**, standing before Him in Love: |
| **5** — Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, | Having **pre-designed** us for **Sonship** — the restored relationship offered through **Jesus Christ** — according to the benevolent intention of His will: |
| **6** — To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved. | To the praise of His radiant grace, by which He has made us **accepted in the Beloved One** — Christ Himself. |

| **The Inner Restoration** | **The Process of Recovery** |
| **7** — In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; | In Christ we have **Redemption** — liberation from the old bondage — through His **blood**, meaning His **self-given life**, granting the forgiveness of our **error-patterns**, according to the abundance of His grace: |
| **8** — Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence; | Which He has poured out on us in **wisdom** (inner illumination) and **prudence** (practical spiritual discernment): |
| **9** — Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself: | Revealing to us the **Mystery of His Will**, according to the delight He purposed within Himself — the plan concealed and now unveiled: |
| **10** — That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ… | That in the **Fullness of Time**, He would **unify all things** in Christ — the higher (Heaven) and the manifest (Earth) — restoring what was fragmented: |
| **11** — In whom also we have obtained an inheritance… | In Christ we have accessed our **Spiritual Inheritance**, having been **blueprinted** according to the purpose of Him who works all things after the counsel of His will: |
| **12** — That we should be to the praise of his glory… | That we, who first placed our trust in Christ, should be the reflection of His glory: |

| **The Awakening of Perception** | **The Seal and The Sight** |
| **13** — In whom ye also trusted… after that ye heard the word of truth… ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, | In Christ you also trusted, after hearing the **Word of Truth** — the message of your salvation. Having believed, you were **sealed** with the **Holy Spirit of promise** — God’s authenticating mark: |
| **14** — Which is the earnest of our inheritance… | Who is the **earnest** — the **first taste** — of your full inheritance, until the complete redemption of the **purchased vessel**, to the praise of His glory. |
| **15** — Wherefore I also… heard of your faith… | Therefore I also, having heard of your **faith in Jesus Christ** and your love toward all the saints, |
| **16** — Cease not to give thanks… | Do not cease giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers; |
| **17** — That… the Father of glory… may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation… | That the **God of our Lord Jesus Christ**, the **Father of Glory**, may grant you the **Spirit of Wisdom** and **Revelation**, in the deep experiential knowledge of Him: |
| **18** — The eyes of your understanding being enlightened… | That the **eyes of your heart** may be **illumined**, so you may know the hope of His calling, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints, |
| **19** — And the exceeding greatness of his power… | And the surpassing greatness of His **power** toward us who believe, operating according to His mighty strength, |
| **20** — Which he wrought in Christ… raised him… set him at his right hand… | Which He exercised in **Christ**, raising Him from the dead, and seating Him at His **right hand** — the place of authority — in the higher realms: |
| **21** — Far above all principality and power… | Far above all **principalities**, **powers**, **forces**, and **names** — every category of authority — in this age and in the age to come: |
| **22** — And hath put all things under his feet… | And placed all things under His feet, making Him the **Head** — the governing center — over all things for the Church, |
| **23** — Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all. | Which is **His Body**, the fullness of Him who fills all things in all ways. |
