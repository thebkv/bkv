## 🗝️ **About**  
The **Bible Key Version (BKV)** is a developing work that mines Scripture to uncover its inherant symbolic meanings and historical depth. 
[link to test2](index-test2.md)
Special attention is given to the original meanings of proper names, and to numbers with well-established significance (such as 7 and 40). 

The Bible Key method lets Scripture interpret itself, opening pathways to deeper study and understanding.  
The BKV can stand alongside your familiar translation as a companion for study.  

Many resources are drawn upon: above all Scripture itself, but also multiple LLMs, Bible Gateway, original languages, early Christian writers, and other public domain materials. LLM formatting is applied for consistency, and automated substitutions are used where results prove reliable. At this stage, the BKV does not attempt to address the TR vs. Critical debate.


No use is made of so-called “Bible codes” or hidden numerology. 

The Bible Key Version project assumes that Scripture is provided by the Holy Spirit, and is true. The symoblics in BKV are based purely on Scripture's own definitions.  

_"Now all these things happened unto them for exsamples."_

## 📜 **Bible Key Primer**  

The Bible Key is a method of reading Scripture that unlocks its inner dimension. It assumes the text is written in layers, where names, numbers, places, and events are not only historical but symbolic — diagrams for living with Christ's presence.  

Core Principles  
	1.	**Symbolic Interpretation**  
	•	Every story is written in symbols and figures of speech. A battle, a journey, or a kingdom is never just literal; it represents movements of the soul, states of mind, or spiritual dynamics.  
	2.	**Original Name Meanings**  
	•	Every name in Scripture carries meaning. Israel = “He struggles with God,” Moses = “Drawn out,” Bethlehem = “House of Bread.” These meanings often reveal the inner message of the passage.  
	3.	**Archetypes and Inner Faculties**  
	•	Biblical characters embody archetypal states of consciousness. For example, Saul represents the natural man, Paul the transformed man; Deborah represents courage when everything seems lost; Peter represents faith.  
	4.	**The Reader’s Inner Experience**  
	•	The Bible is a mirror. Each reader is present on every page. Noah’s Ark is your retreat into God’s presence. David’s battle is your confrontation with fear. The stories become diagrams for your inner journey.  
	5.	**Life Application**  
	•	Scripture is not merely about ancient events. It shows how to live today. Egypt means bondage, wilderness means transition, Canaan means fullness. These patterns replay in our own lives whenever we face struggle, choice, or renewal.  
	6.	**Narrative Keys**  
	•	Repetition, parallelism, and names-with-meanings act as built-in interpretive keys. When the Bible defines a name (e.g., Emmanuel: “God with us”), it signals that other names should also be read for their meaning.  
	7.	**Transformational Reading**  
	•	To read with the Bible Key is to allow the text to act as a personal biography of the soul. It doesn’t just tell what happened, it shows what is happening in you now, and what could happen if you rise into God’s presence.

Contributors: Use following conventions:  
Start chapters with identifying operational terms (see examples)  
Base text KJV or other standard accepted word for word text  
Substitute names for meanings where scripture has a direct or clearly implied definition - example: Jerusalem = City of Peace  
Use markdown italics for readability words like _the_  
Use markdown bold for defined names and terms like **City of Peace**  
When substituting Hebrew or Greek meanings, use commonly accrpted definitions  
Close chapter with translation notes and references (see examples)  
Do not add commentary, let scripture speak for itself  
Ask God for inspiration and guidance while working  
Include project GUID (below) at end of chapter  
Add a custom chapter GUID if you are creating a new file or make substantial changes  
  No need for new Chapter GUID if fine tuning for fixing mistakes  
  Optional: Save your GUIDs in notes or your chat, they may help you find your way back down the road
