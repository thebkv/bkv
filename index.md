# The Bible Key Version (BKV)

---

## 🗝️ About
The **Bible Key Version (BKV)** is a developing work that mines Scripture to uncover its inherant symbolic meanings and historical depth.  

Special attention is given to the original meanings of proper names, and to numbers with well-established significance (such as 7 and 40). 

The Bible Key method lets Scripture interpret itself, opening pathways to deeper study and understanding.  
The BKV can stand alongside your familiar translation as a companion for study.  

Many resources are drawn upon: above all Scripture itself, but also multiple LLMs, Bible Gateway, original languages, early Christian writers, and other public domain materials. LLM formatting is applied for consistency, and automated substitutions are used where results prove reliable. At this stage, the BKV does not attempt to address the TR vs. Critical debate.


No use is made of so-called “Bible codes” or hidden numerology. 

The Bible Key Version project assumes that Scripture is provided by the Holy Spirit, and is true. Symoblism and analogy are based purely on Scripture's own definitions.

This is a draft workspace: chapters may change as the work continues.

Bible Key Primer

📜 Bible Key Primer  

The Bible Key is a method of reading Scripture that unlocks its inner dimension. It assumes the text is written in layers, where names, numbers, places, and events are not only historical but symbolic — diagrams for living.  

Core Principles  
	1.	Symbolic Interpretation  
	•	Every story is written in symbols and figures of speech. A battle, a journey, or a kingdom is never just literal; it represents movements of the soul, states of mind, or spiritual dynamics.  
	2.	Original Name Meanings  
	•	Every name in Scripture carries meaning. Israel = “He struggles with God,” Moses = “Drawn out,” Bethlehem = “House of Bread.” These meanings often reveal the inner message of the passage.  
	3.	Archetypes and Inner Faculties  
	•	Biblical characters embody archetypal states of consciousness. For example, Saul represents the natural man, Paul the transformed man; Deborah represents courage when everything seems lost; Peter represents faith.  
	4.	The Reader’s Inner Experience  
	•	The Bible is a mirror. Each reader is present on every page. Noah’s Ark is your retreat into God’s presence. David’s battle is your confrontation with fear. The stories become diagrams for your inner journey.  
	5.	Life Application  
	•	Scripture is not merely about ancient events. It shows how to live today. Egypt means bondage, wilderness means transition, Canaan means fullness. These patterns replay in our own lives whenever we face struggle, choice, or renewal.  
	6.	Narrative Keys  
	•	Repetition, parallelism, and names-with-meanings act as built-in interpretive keys. When the Bible defines a name (e.g., Emmanuel: “God with us”), it signals that other names should also be read for their meaning.  
	7.	Transformational Reading  
	•	To read with the Bible Key is to allow the text to act as a personal biography of the soul. It doesn’t just tell what happened, it shows what is happening in you now, and what could happen if you rise into God’s presence.
