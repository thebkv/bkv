## 🗝️ About
The **Bible Key Version (BKV)** is a developing work that mines Scripture to uncover its symbolic meanings and historical depth.  

Special attention is given to the original meanings of proper names, and to numbers with well-established significance (such as 7 and 40). 

The Bible Key method lets Scripture interpret itself, opening pathways to deeper study and understanding.  
The BKV can stand alongside your familiar translation as a companion for study.  

Many resources are drawn upon: above all Scripture itself, but also multiple LLMs, Bible Gateway, original languages, early Christian writers, and other public domain materials. LLM formatting is applied for consistency, and automated substitutions are used where results prove reliable. At this stage, the BKV does not attempt to address the TR vs. Critical debate.

No use is made of so-called “Bible codes” or hidden numerology. 

This is a draft workspace: chapters may change as the work continues.
