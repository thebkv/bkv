# **1 Timothy 6 — BKV Study (The Doctrine of Inner Wealth and Final Charge)**
### *Mastery Over Desire: The True Contentment and the Great Deposit*

---

> *“But godliness with contentment is great gain.” — 1 Timothy 6:6 KJV*
> *“Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life.” — 1 Timothy 6:12 KJV*

*“The ultimate test of the spiritual faculty is its ability to govern its own desire, recognizing that true wealth is not accumulated but realized.”*

## **BKV-NR Context**

**1 Timothy 6** serves as the **final charge and summation** of the epistle. Having established Doctrine (Ch. 1), Order (Ch. 2), Governance (Ch. 3), Maintenance (Ch. 4), and Stewardship (Ch. 5), the final chapter addresses the **root cause of all spiritual disorder: *misdirected desire***. It contrasts **false wealth (greed)** with **true wealth (godliness with contentment)** and concludes with the final, urgent mandate to the dedicated faculty (**Timothy**).

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

1.  Let as many **servants** (subordinate, laboring faculties) as are under the yoke count their own **masters** (governing principles) worthy of all **honour**, that the name of the Source and his doctrine be not blasphemed.
2.  And they that have **believing masters** (principles aligned with truth), let them not despise them... but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit.
3.  If any man **teach otherwise** and consents not to **wholesome words** (integrated truths)... he is **proud**, knowing nothing, but doting about **questions and strifes of words** (intellectual arguments)...
5.  ...supposing that **gain is godliness** (equating spiritual reward with egoic profit): from such withdraw thyself.
6.  But **godliness with contentment** is **great gain** (true spiritual wealth is internal realization).
7.  For we brought **nothing into this world** (consciousness), and it is certain we can carry **nothing out** (no accumulation is eternal).
9.  But they that will be **rich** (faculties dominated by craving) fall into **temptation and a snare**, and into many **foolish and hurtful lusts** which drown men in **destruction and perdition** (spiritual annihilation).
10. For the **love of money** (attachment to egoic accumulation) is the **root of all evil**...
11. But thou, O **Dedicated Faculty (Timothy)**, flee these things; and follow after **righteousness**, **godliness**, **faith**, **love**, **patience**, and **meekness**.
12. **Fight the good fight of faith** (engage in conscious spiritual discipline), **lay hold on eternal life** (realize timeless awareness), whereunto thou art also called.
17. Charge them that are **rich in this world** (faculties possessing great temporal power) that they be not **highminded**, nor trust in **uncertain riches**, but in the **Living Source**...
18. That they do **good**, that they be **rich in good works**, ready to **distribute**, willing to **communicate** (use temporal power for active spiritual good and communication of truth).
20. O **Timothy**, keep that which is **committed to thy trust** (the core deposit of revealed truth), avoiding **profane and vain babblings** (disorderly thoughts) and **oppositions of science falsely so called** (intellectual arrogance posing as truth).

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Timothy 6** establishes the **Doctrine of Inner Wealth**. The most profound spiritual danger is not external, but the internal **"love of money"**—the *craving* for egoic profit or spiritual status.

### **Godliness and Contentment (v. 6–10)**
The BKV-NR principle states that **real gain is internal alignment**. Since the soul brings nothing into and takes nothing out of the manifested consciousness, focusing on accumulation is vanity. **Contentment** is the recognition that the essential spiritual resources (*food and raiment*) are sufficient. The desire to be **"rich"** is the **craving for spiritual status or power** motivated by ego, which leads to the "snare" of self-deception and spiritual destruction.

### **The Final Charge: The Great Deposit (v. 12, 20)**
The counter-action to craving is the **"good fight of faith"**—the vigorous, conscious spiritual discipline required to **lay hold on eternal life** (realize timeless awareness). The final, urgent mandate is to **"keep that which is committed to thy trust"**—the **Great Deposit (Parathēkē)**, which is the entire body of Core Truth and Integrated Order established in Chapters 1-5. This is protected by actively avoiding **vain babblings** and **intellectual arrogance** (oppositions of science falsely so called).

## **Cross-References and Thematic Parallels**

The following passages reinforce the closing theme of **1 Timothy 6**—that *true stewardship is the balance of contentment, integrity, and devotion to the Source rather than attachment to material gain.* Each text reflects a complementary aspect of this spiritual law of sufficiency.

| Reference | Theme in 1 Timothy 6 | Contribution to the BKV-NR Study |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Philippians 4:10–19** | **Godliness with Contentment is Great Gain (v. 6); Sufficiency (v. 8)** | This is the most direct parallel. It defines *Contentment* not as a passive state but as a **learned discipline**—the ability of the soul to maintain stability regardless of the influx or outflow of **inner resources** (temporal wealth). It validates the principle that the **Source supplies all needs**. |
| **Matthew 6:19–21** | **Love of Money is the Root of All Evil (v. 10); Temporal vs. Eternal (v. 7)** | Directly supports the contrast between **false accumulation** (earthly riches, which are transient) and **true wealth** (heavenly treasures, realized awareness). It reinforces the BKV-NR principle that no accumulation is eternal and that focus must rest upon the **Inner Deposit (v. 20)**. |
| **1 Timothy 5:17–25** | **Stewardship of Inner Resources (vv. 17–19); Impartiality and Authority (v. 21)** | Though from the preceding chapter, it relates to the final charge by defining **responsible action for “rich” faculties**. The call to honor elders (mature wisdom) and practice good works becomes the **responsible use of inner power**, contrasting with those who treat *gain as godliness*. |
| **Hebrews 13:5–6** | **Godliness with Contentment (v. 6); The Living Source (v. 17)** | Reinforces the **Doctrine of Sufficiency**. The warning against the love of money directly supports the idea that **craving is the root of spiritual evil (v. 10)** and anchors contentment in the assurance of the **Living Source’s presence and support**. |
