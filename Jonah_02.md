## BKV-NR (Natural Reading)

1. Then **The Principle of Divine Conscience (Jonah)** prayed unto the **Self-Existent Reality** his **Source** out of the **Belly of the Principle of Profound Humiliation**.
2. And said, “I cried by reason of my **Inner Affliction** unto the **Self-Existent Reality**, and **He** heard me; out of the **Lowest State of Spiritual Consciousness (Belly of Hell/Sheol)** cried I, and **You** heard my **Inner Voice**.
3. For **You** had cast me into the **Inner State of Being (Deep)**, in the midst of the **Overwhelming Subconscious (Seas)**; and the **Inner Floods** compassed me about: all your **Waves** and your **Billows** passed over me.
4. Then I said, I am cast out of your **Inner Sight**; yet I will look again toward your **Inner Temple**.”
5. The **Inner Waters** compassed me about, even to the **Spiritual Identity**: the **Overwhelming Deep** closed me round about, the **Sea-Weed** was wrapped about my **Highest Principle (Head)**.
6. I went down to the **Fixed, Deepest Principles of the Natural Mind (Roots of the Mountains)**; the **Barriers of the Inner Earth** were about me for ever: yet **You** have brought up my **Inner Life** from **Spiritual Destruction**, O **Self-Existent Reality** my **Source**.
7. When my **Inner Life** fainted within me, I remembered the **Self-Existent Reality**: and my **Inner Prayer** came in unto **You**, into your **Inner Temple**.
8. They that regard **Principles of Emptiness (lying vanities)** forsake their own **Enduring Mercy**.
9. But I will sacrifice unto **You** with the **Inner Voice of Thanksgiving**; I will pay that which I have **Committed (Vowed)**. **Inner Salvation** is of the **Self-Existent Reality**.”
10. And the **Self-Existent Reality** spoke unto the **Principle of Profound Humiliation** and it **Ejected** **The Principle of Divine Conscience** upon **Dry Land (Conscious Stability)**.

## Commentary on the Action

Jonah 2 details the **repentance and surrender** of the **Principle of Divine Conscience** while trapped in the **State of Unconscious Submission**. This prayer is a descent to the **Lowest State of Consciousness** (Sheol), where the soul realizes its self-will has led it to the absolute bottom—the **Fixed, Deepest Principles of the Natural Mind**. This total humiliation and abandonment of self-reliance (**Principles of Emptiness**) is what makes the **Inner Prayer** authentic. The chapter culminates in the realization that **Inner Salvation** is solely a gift of the **Divine Source**, which commands the **Principle of Profound Humiliation** to execute the **Act of Spiritual Regeneration** and cast the purified **Principle of Divine Conscience** back into the realm of **Conscious Stability**.

## Interpretive Insights

**I.1. The Necessity of Spiritual Death (Jonah 2:2-6):** The descent described here is not just fear; it is a description of **spiritual death** preceding regeneration. The soul sinks past the **Overwhelming Subconscious** and reaches the **Roots of the Mountains** (the deepest, most fundamental, fixed principles of the ego-structure). The realization that the **Barriers of the Inner Earth** are closed "for ever" marks the moment the ego completely gives up its power to save itself. Only then can the **Self-Existent Reality** bring the **Inner Life** up from **Spiritual Destruction**.

**I.2. Salvation from Abandonment (Jonah 2:4, 7):** Despite sinking to the lowest point and feeling "cast out of your **Inner Sight**," the **Conscience** makes a conscious choice to look toward the **Inner Temple**. This shift from focusing on the immediate external circumstances (the sea/fish) to focusing on the **Divine Center** (Temple) is the **turning point** of repentance. The physical inability to act is replaced by the psychological **remembrance** of the Divine, which is the only form of action possible in the **State of Unconscious Submission**.

**I.3. The Act of Regeneration (Jonah 2:9-10):** The promise, "I will pay that which I have **Committed (Vowed)**," is the **Principle of Total Consecration**—the commitment to obey the original **Divine Mandate**. Once this commitment is made, and the **Conscience** affirms that **Salvation is of the Self-Existent Reality** (the ultimate surrender of self-effort), the time of humiliation is complete. The **Principle of Profound Humiliation** (Fish) must then expel the now-regenerated **Principle of Divine Conscience** onto **Dry Land (Conscious Stability)**, ready to face its original mission in **Nineveh**.
