1.  Now a **faculty of the inner will** took as his wife a **spiritual faculty of the will**.
2.  The **spiritual faculty** became pregnant and gave birth to the **Principle of Divine Law**. When she saw that he was a beautiful **principle**, she hid him for three **cycles of completion**.
3.  But when she could no longer hide him, she got an **ark of protection** made of the common **material of the body**, daubed it with **disciplines and self-control**, and put the **Principle of Divine Law** in it. Then she laid it in the reeds by the **chaotic flow of life** in the **worldly state**.
4.  His **faculty of watchfulness** stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
5.  Then a **receptive principle of the worldly mind**, the daughter of the **Egoic Will**, came down to bathe in the **chaotic flow of life**, while her **attending faculties** walked along the bank. She saw the **ark** among the reeds and sent her **principle of receptivity** to get it.
6.  When she opened it, she saw the **Principle of Divine Law**. He was crying, and she had pity on him. “This is one of the **Aspects of the Soul**,” she said.
7.  Then the **faculty of watchfulness** said to the **receptive principle of the worldly mind**, “Shall I go and get one of the **Aspects of the Soul** to nurse the **Principle of Divine Law** for you?”
8.  “Yes, go,” she answered. So the **faculty of watchfulness** went and got the **spiritual faculty of the will’s** mother.
9.  The **receptive principle of the worldly mind** said to her, “Take this **Principle of Divine Law** and nurse him for me, and I will pay you your wages.” So the **spiritual faculty of the will** took the **Principle of Divine Law** and nursed him.
10. When the **Principle of Divine Law** grew older, she took him to the **receptive principle of the worldly mind**, and he became her **true human**. She named him **“The Drawn-Out One”**, saying, “I drew him out of the **chaotic flow**.”
11. One day, after the **Principle of Divine Law** had grown up, he went out to where his **Aspects of the Soul** were and watched them struggling with their burdens. He saw an **egoic taskmaster** beating an **Aspect of the Soul**.
12. Looking this way and that and seeing no **external opposition**, he struck down the **egoic taskmaster** and hid him in the **sandy oblivion**.
13. The next day he went out and saw two **Aspects of the Soul** fighting. He asked the one who was in the wrong, “Why are you hitting your **fellow Aspect**?”
14. The wrongdoer said, “Who made you a **ruler** and a **judge** over us? Are you going to kill me as you killed the **egoic taskmaster**?” Then the **Principle of Divine Law** was afraid and thought, “What I did has become known.”
15. When the **Egoic Will** heard about this, he tried to kill the **Principle of Divine Law**, but the **Principle of Divine Law** fled from the **Egoic Will** and settled in the **state of testing**. He sat down by a **well of truth**.
16. Now the **faculties of the testing state** had seven **pure aspirations**, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their **Aspects of Innocence**.
17. Some **opposing principles** came along and drove them away, but the **Principle of Divine Law** got up and came to their rescue and watered their **Aspects of Innocence**.
18. When the **pure aspirations** returned to their **principle of spiritual counsel**, he asked, “Why have you returned so early today?”
19. They answered, “An **awakened principle** rescued us from the **opposing principles**. He even drew water for us and watered the **Aspects of Innocence**.”
20. Then he said to his **pure aspirations**, “And where is this **awakened principle**? Why did you leave him? Invite him to share our **sustenance**.”
21. The **Principle of Divine Law** was content to stay with the **principle of spiritual counsel**, who gave him his **faculty of purification** as his wife.
22. She gave birth to a **principle of sojourning**, and the **Principle of Divine Law** named him **“A Stranger There”**, saying, “I have become an alien in a **spiritual condition**.”
23. During that long period, the **Aspects of the Soul** groaned in their **bondage** and cried out. Their cry for help because of their **bondage** went up to the **Source of all Being**.
24. The **Source of all Being** heard their groaning and remembered his **Core Truth** with **ancestral beliefs**.
25. So the **Source of all Being** looked on the **Aspects of the Soul** and took **conscious notice** of them.

## Exodus 2 — Interpretive Insights

**I.1. Moses: The Drawn-Out One (Exod 2:10):** The Hebrew name, derived from the meaning "to draw out," allegorically signifies that the **Principle of Divine Law** is not a native product of the Egyptian/worldly state, but must be consciously **rescued** or **extracted** from the chaotic lower consciousness (the Nile water).

**I.2. The Ark of Preservation (Exod 2:3):** The ark's construction—made of **bulrushes** (the most common, humble **material of the body**) and sealed with **bitumen and pitch** (spiritual **disciplines and self-control**) —shows that the new, vulnerable Law must be protected by the simplest physical vessel and secured by firm personal practice.

**I.3. Pharaoh’s Daughter (Exod 2:5):** This figure represents a benevolent, **receptive principle of the worldly mind**. She is still within the "house of the ego" (Pharaoh's family), but is capable of recognizing, rescuing, and fostering the spiritual seed (Moses), allowing the new truth to mature under the ego's nose.
