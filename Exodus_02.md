**Exodus 2 — BKV Study (The Birth and Flight of the Principle of Divine Law)**

*The Principle of Divine Law (Moses) is initially preserved by the humble material of the human vessel and is drawn out of the chaotic self by a receptive faculty; his later exile in Midian is the necessary period of testing to mature the law before its mission.*

>*“She placed the child in an ark of bulrushes…”*  
>*“And the daughter of Pharaoh drew him out of the water.”*

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

Now a **faculty of the inner will** took as his wife a **spiritual faculty of the will**.

The **spiritual faculty** conceived and gave birth to the **Principle of Divine Law**. When she perceived the **principle’s beauty** — its harmony with the Divine — she hid him for three **cycles of completion**.

When she could hide him no longer, she prepared an **ark of protection**, fashioned from the **common material of embodiment**, sealed with **disciplines and self-control**, and placed the **Principle of Divine Law** within. Then she set it among the reeds beside the **chaotic flow of life** in the **worldly state**.

His **faculty of watchfulness** stood at a distance to see what would become of him.

Then a **receptive principle of the worldly mind**, the daughter of the **Egoic Will**, came down to bathe in the **chaotic flow of life**, while her **attending faculties** walked along the bank. She saw the **ark** among the reeds and sent her **principle of receptivity** to fetch it.

When she opened it, she saw the **Principle of Divine Law**. He was crying, and she had pity on him. “This is one of the **Aspects of the Soul**,” she said.

Then the **faculty of watchfulness** said to the **receptive principle of the worldly mind**, “Shall I bring you one of the **Aspects of the Soul** to nurse the **Principle of Divine Law** for you?”

“Yes, go,” she answered. So the **faculty of watchfulness** went and brought the **spiritual faculty of the will’s mother**.

The **receptive principle of the worldly mind** said, “Take this **Principle of Divine Law** and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” So the **spiritual faculty of the will** took the **Principle of Divine Law** and nursed him.

When the **Principle of Divine Law** matured, she brought him to the **receptive principle of the worldly mind**, and he became her **apparent son**. She named him **“The Drawn-Out One,”** saying, “I drew him out of the **chaotic flow**.”

One day, after the **Principle of Divine Law** had grown, he went out to where his **Aspects of the Soul** labored and saw their burdens. He observed an **egoic taskmaster** striking an **Aspect of the Soul**.

Looking this way and that and seeing no **external opposition**, he struck down the **egoic taskmaster** and hid him in the **sandy oblivion**.

The next day he saw two **Aspects of the Soul** striving together. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why do you strike your **fellow Aspect**?”

The wrongdoer replied, “Who made you a **ruler and judge** over us? Will you kill me as you killed the **egoic taskmaster**?” Then the **Principle of Divine Law** feared and thought, “The matter is known.”

When the **Egoic Will** heard of it, he sought to destroy the **Principle of Divine Law**. But the **Principle of Divine Law** fled from the **Egoic Will** and dwelt in the **state of testing**. He sat beside a **well of truth**.

Now the **faculties of the testing state** had seven **pure aspirations**. They came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their **Aspects of Innocence**.

Some **opposing principles** came and drove them away, but the **Principle of Divine Law** rose, defended them, and watered their **Aspects of Innocence**.

When the **pure aspirations** returned to their **principle of spiritual counsel**, he asked, “Why have you come so soon today?”

They answered, “An **awakened principle** rescued us from the **opposing principles**. He even drew water for us and watered the **Aspects of Innocence**.”

Then he said to his **pure aspirations**, “Where is this **awakened principle**? Why did you leave him? Invite him to share our **sustenance**.”

The **Principle of Divine Law** was content to dwell with the **principle of spiritual counsel**, who gave him his **faculty of purification** as wife.

She bore a **principle of sojourning**, and the **Principle of Divine Law** named him **‘A Stranger There,’** saying, “I have become an alien in a **spiritual condition**.”

In those many days the **Aspects of the Soul** groaned under their **bondage** and cried out; their cry rose to the **Source of All Being**.

The **Source of All Being** heard their groaning and remembered His **Core Truth** with **ancestral beliefs**.

The **Source of All Being** looked upon the **Aspects of the Soul** and took **conscious notice** of them.

## **Interpretive Insights**

**I.1 — Moses: The Drawn-Out One (2:10)**
The name signifies that the **Principle of Divine Law** is not native to the lower, worldly consciousness but must be **rescued**—*drawn out*—from the chaotic current of material thought. Every spiritual awakening involves this deliberate extraction.

**I.2 — The Ark of Preservation (2:3)**
Constructed of humble **bulrushes** — the most ordinary **material of embodiment** — and sealed with **bitumen and pitch** (steadfast **discipline and self-control**), the ark shows that the Divine seed must first be protected by the simplest human vessel and safeguarded through practice. **That which is lowest becomes the cradle of that which is highest.**

**I.3 — Pharaoh’s Daughter (2:5)**
The **receptive principle of the worldly mind** acts as an unconscious agent of grace. Though within the house of the **Egoic Will**, she can recognize and nurture the spiritual seed. She is the psychological parallel to **Rahab of Jericho**: both feminine powers of protection within hostile systems, both instruments of the Spirit’s mercy.

## **Closing Transition**

Thus the **Principle of Divine Law** matures in exile.

The soul, though alien within the world of confusion, begins to awaken a cry toward its Source.

**Bondage gives birth to longing; longing summons remembrance; remembrance awakens deliverance.**

The next revelation will unveil the Presence that answers this cry.
