_“She placed the child in an ark of bulrushes…”_  
_“And the daughter of Pharaoh drew him out of the water.”_

1. Now a **faculty of the inner will** took as his wife a **spiritual faculty of the will**.
2. The **spiritual faculty** became pregnant and gave birth to a **Principle of Divine Law**. When she saw that he was a beautiful **principle**, she hid him for three **cycles of completion**.
3. But when she could no longer hide him, she got an **ark of protection** made of the common **material of the body**, daubed it with **disciplines and self-control**, and put the **Principle of Divine Law** in it. Then she laid it in the reeds by the **flow of life** in the **worldly state**.
4. His **faculty of watchfulness** stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.
5. Then a **principle of the worldly mind**, the **daughter of the ego**, came down to bathe in the **flow of life**, while her **attending faculties** walked along the bank. She saw the **ark** among the reeds and sent her **principle of receptivity** to get it.
6. When she opened it, she saw the **Principle of Divine Law**. He was crying, and she had pity on him. “This is one of the **principles of the spiritual identities**,” she said.
7. Then the **faculty of watchfulness** said to the **principle of the worldly mind**, “Shall I go and get one of the **spiritual identities** to nurse the **Principle of Divine Law** for you?”
8. “Yes, go,” she answered. So the **faculty of watchfulness** went and got the **spiritual faculty of the will’s** mother.
9. The **principle of the worldly mind** said to her, “Take this **Principle of Divine Law** and nurse him for me, and I will pay you your wages.” So the **spiritual faculty of the will** took the **Principle of Divine Law** and nursed him.
10. When the **Principle of Divine Law** grew older, she took him to the **principle of the worldly mind**, and he became her **true human**. She named him **“The Drawn-Out One”**, saying, “I drew him out of the **chaotic flow**.”
11. One day, after the **Principle of Divine Law** had grown up, he went out to where his **spiritual identities** were and watched them struggling with their burdens. He saw an **egoic taskmaster** beating a **spiritual identity**.
12. Looking this way and that and seeing no **external opposition**, he struck down the **egoic taskmaster** and hid him in the **sandy oblivion**.
13. The next day he went out and saw two **spiritual identities** fighting. He asked the one who was in the wrong, “Why are you hitting your **fellow principle**?”
14. The wrongdoer said, “Who made you a **ruler** and a **judge** over us? Are you going to kill me as you killed the **egoic taskmaster**?” Then the **Principle of Divine Law** was afraid and thought, “What I did has become known.”
15. When the **egoic will** heard about this, he tried to kill the **Principle of Divine Law**, but the **Principle of Divine Law** fled from the **egoic will** and settled in the **state of testing**. He sat down by a **well of truth**.
16. Now the **principles of the testing state** had seven **pure aspirations**, and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their **principles of innocence**.
17. Some **opposing principles** came along and drove them away, but the **Principle of Divine Law** got up and came to their rescue and watered their **principles of innocence**.
18. When the **pure aspirations** returned to their **principle of spiritual counsel**, he asked, “Why have you returned so early today?”
19. They answered, “An **awakened principle** rescued us from the **opposing principles**. He even drew water for us and watered the **principles of innocence**.”
20. Then he said to his **pure aspirations**, “And where is this **awakened principle**? Why did you leave him? Invite him to share our **sustenance**.”
21. The **Principle of Divine Law** was content to stay with the **principle of spiritual counsel**, who gave him his **faculty of purification** as his wife.
22. She gave birth to a **principle of sojourning**, and the **Principle of Divine Law** named him **“A Stranger There”**, saying, “I have become an alien in a **spiritual condition**.”
23. During that long period, the **spiritual identities** groaned in their **bondage** and cried out. Their cry for help because of their **bondage** went up to the **Source of all Being**.
24. The **Source of all Being** heard their groaning and remembered his **inner agreement** with **ancestral beliefs**.
25. So the **Source of all Being** looked on the **spiritual identities** and took **conscious notice** of them.
