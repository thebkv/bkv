# Ezekiel 12

### **BKV (Bible Key Version)**

1. The word of the **Absolute Source** also came to me, saying,
2. **True Consciousness**, you dwell within a **rebellious house**—the part of the mind that has the capacity to see and yet does not see; it has the capacity to hear and yet does not hear. For it is a state of mind that resists divine truth.
3. Therefore, you **True Consciousness**, prepare the **burdens** for your inner journey, and set forth by the light of day, in the sight of those resistant thoughts; and you shall move from your current state to a new state in their sight. Perhaps they will consider their way, though they be a **rebellious house**.
4. Then you shall bring forth your **burdens** by day in their sight, as one prepares for a great shift in consciousness. And you shall go forth at twilight, in their sight, as those who enter into **spiritual bondage**.
5. **Dig through the wall** of old self-imposed limits in their sight, and carry out your belongings by that new way.
6. In their sight you shall bear it upon your shoulders, and carry it forth in the fading light of egoic understanding. You shall cover your face so that you do not see the ground, for I have made you a **sign** to the state of **spiritual consciousness**.
7. And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my **burdens** by day, as one preparing for a great shift, and in the evening I **dug through the wall** with my own inner effort; I carried it forth in the fading light, and I bore it upon my shoulder in the sight of my old thoughts.
8. And in the morning, the word of the **Absolute** came to me, saying,
9. **True Consciousness**, has not the state of **spiritual consciousness**, the **rebellious house**, said to you, “What are you doing?”
10. Say to them, “Thus says the **Absolute Source**: This **burden** concerns the **egoic will** in your state of peace, and all the faculties of consciousness that are with it.”
11. Say, “I am your **sign**: just as I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall enter a state of **spiritual bondage**.”
12. And the **egoic will** that is among them shall bear its own **burdens** upon its shoulder in the twilight of understanding, and shall go forth. They shall **dig through the wall** of their own creation to carry out their identity by that way. It shall cover its face, so that it sees not the inner reality with its own eyes.
13. I will also spread my **net** of inevitable consequences upon it, and it shall be caught in my **snare**. And I will bring it to a state of **chaotic inner confusion**—to the land of **false beliefs**; yet it shall not see its end, though it will die there.
14. And I will scatter toward every distraction all the thoughts that gather around it to support it, and all its fleeting attachments; and I will draw out the sword of inner truth after them.
15. And they shall know that I am the **Absolute Source**, when I shall scatter their thoughts among different inner states, and disperse them in new fields of experience.
16. But I will leave a few men of them from the sword of truth, from the starvation of meaning, and from the sickness of spiritual decline; so that they may bear witness to their old way of **unwholesome thinking** among the unawakened thoughts wherever they are found; and they shall know that I am the **Absolute Source**.
17. Furthermore, the word of the **Absolute** came to me, saying,
18. **True Consciousness**, eat your spiritual sustenance with **inner trembling**, and drink your **life-giving truth** with an inner quaking and with inner mindfulness;
19. And say to the inner workings of the self, “Thus says the **Absolute Source** to the **inhabitants** of your inner peace, and of the state of **spiritual consciousness**: They shall eat their sustenance with mindfulness, and drink their life-giving truth with profound introspection, so that their inner reality may be cleansed of all that is therein, because of the inner violence of all the thoughts that dwell there.”
20. And the entrenched patterns of thought shall be laid waste, and the inner reality shall be cleansed; and you shall know that I am the **Absolute Source**.
21. And the word of the **Absolute** came to me, saying,
22. **True Consciousness**, what is this limited belief that you have in the state of **spiritual consciousness**, saying, “The days are far off, and every **spiritual vision** fails?”
23. Tell them, “Thus says the **Absolute Source**: I will make this limited belief cease, and they shall no longer use it as a proverb. But tell them, **The time is at hand**, and the fulfillment of every **spiritual vision**.”
24. For there shall be no more any **vain spiritual vision** or deceptive inner foretelling within the state of **spiritual consciousness**.
25. For I am the **Absolute Source**: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall no longer be put off. For in your days, O **rebellious state of mind**, will I speak the word, and will perform it, says the **Absolute Source**.
26. Again the word of the **Absolute** came to me, saying,
27. **True Consciousness**, behold, those of the state of **spiritual consciousness** say, “The **vision** that he sees is for a long time to come, and he speaks of things that are far off.”
28. Therefore, say to them, “Thus says the **Absolute Source**: There shall none of my words be put off any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done.”

## **Interpretive Summary**

Ezekiel 12 is an internal allegory for the necessary dismantling and reconstruction of the self. The central theme is the **relocation of consciousness** from a state of rebellion to a new, more aligned state. The prophet Ezekiel, as the **True Consciousness**, is given a series of symbolic actions to perform, which are not just historical events but an internal **diagram** for the inner work of the soul.

The **rebellious house of Israel** represents the state of consciousness—or the ego—that has eyes but does not see the truth of its condition. The act of **preparing baggage and digging through the wall** is the process of breaking through self-imposed limitations and past patterns. The baggage represents the **burdens** and old identities one must carry with them as they transition. The symbolic journey into **captivity** signifies the necessary surrender of the old self to a new, more restricted and disciplined state.

The **prince of Jerusalem** is the **egoic will**, the ruling thought-form that is the primary source of the rebellion. Its journey into captivity represents the humbling and ultimate dissolution of this egoic will. The **fear and trembling** with which one eats and drinks signifies the deep-seated anxiety and carefulness that accompany the profound inner change, as the old, established patterns are laid waste.

Ultimately, the chapter confronts the common self-deception that spiritual change is always "for the future." The message is clear: the **Absolute Source**’s word is immediate. The fulfillment of spiritual **vision** and the consequences of inner resistance are not a distant threat but an imminent reality. The events described are a powerful illustration of the inner process that must occur for a rebellious consciousness to be purified and brought into alignment with divine truth.


## **Original Text: Ezekiel 12 (King James Version)**

1. The word of the Lord also came unto me, saying,
2. Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a rebellious house.
3. Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.
4. Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as they that go forth into captivity.
5. Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby.
6. In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not the ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.
7. And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for removing, and in the evening I digged through the wall with mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon my shoulder in their sight.
8. And in the morning came the word of the Lord unto me, saying,
9. Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?
10. Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are among them.
11. Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: they shall remove and go into captivity.
12. And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.
13. My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.
14. And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after them.
15. And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.
16. But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I am the Lord.
17. Moreover the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
18. Son of man, eat thy bread with trembling, and drink thy water with quaking and with carefulness;
19. And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.
20. And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
21. And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
22. Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?
23. Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.
24. For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of Israel.
25. For I am the Lord: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.
26. Again the word of the Lord came to me, saying,
27. Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times that are far off.
28. Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done.
