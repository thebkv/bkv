# Isaiah 28 — BKV Study (The Principle of the True Foundation)
### *From Vain Reliance to the Corner Stone*

---

> _“Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.”_ — Isaiah 28:16 KJV
> _“For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.”_ — Isaiah 28:20 KJV

*The **Source** rejects all self-generated, fragmented attempts at **Alignment**—whether born of **Pride (Ephraim)** or **False Covenant (Jerusalem)**. The true structure of consciousness must be built exclusively upon the **Corner Stone**—the **Principle of Divine Humanity**—which alone provides a **Sure Foundation** against the **Flood** of temporal chaos.*

## BKV-NR Context — Judgment on Pride and False Covenant

**Isaiah 28** opens a new segment of prophecy by addressing two primary failures within consciousness, symbolized by the two Hebrew kingdoms: **Ephraim (the North)** and **Judah (Jerusalem/the South)**. The condemnation of **Ephraim** targets **spiritual pride** and intoxication with manifested life (“drunkards of Ephraim”). The condemnation of **Jerusalem** targets **False Covenant**—relying on human schemes and self-made laws instead of the Divine plan. Paul later references this chapter (Romans 9:33; 1 Peter 2:6), establishing the **Corner Stone** (Christ / Divine Humanity) as the definitive **Foundation** that must replace all false agreements and fragmented works.

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

### **The Condemnation of Spiritual Pride**
1. Woe to the **Crown of Pride** (self-exaltation) of the **Fragmented Will (Ephraim)**, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which is on the head of the **Fat Valley** (ease and indulgence) of them that are **Overcome by Wine** (spiritual intoxication).
4. And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the **Fat Valley**, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when he that looks upon it sees, while it is yet in his hand, he eats it up.
6. Yet to the remnant of the **Aligned Faculties**, the **Source Himself** shall be for a **Crown of Glory** and for **Strength** to those who turn the **Battle to the Gate**.

### **The Mockery of Instruction**
7. Even the **interpreting faculties** (**Priests and Prophets**) stumble through the same intoxication, mocking the simplicity of the **Word**: “Line upon line, precept upon precept.” Their lips are filled with fragmented speech, and their hearts cannot receive the order of **Divine Teaching**.
11. Therefore, by **Stammering Lips** and **Another Tongue** shall He speak to this people — for **Truth** will find its way through every language, even when the mind resists it.

### **The Inadequacy of Human Security (False Covenant)**
15. Because you have said, “We have made a **Covenant with Death** (reliance on the end of things), and with **Chaos** (hell) are we at agreement; when the **Overflowing Scourge** (Flood of chaos) shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made **Lies our Refuge** (self-deception), and under **Falsehood** have we hid ourselves.”
20. For the **Bed** (place of Rest) is **Shorter** than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the **Covering** (security) is **Narrower** than that he can wrap himself in it.

### **The Sole Foundation**
16. Therefore thus says the **Source**: Behold, I lay in **Zion** (Elevated Consciousness) for a **Foundation** a **Stone**, a **Tried Stone**, a **Precious Corner Stone**, a **Sure Foundation**: he that **Believes** (aligns his faith) shall not **Make Haste** (be frantic or fragmented).
17. **Judgment** also will I lay to the line, and **Righteousness** to the plummet: and the **Hail** (Divine Chastisement) shall sweep away the **Refuge of Lies**, and the **Waters** shall overflow the **Hiding Place**.

### **The Divine Calibration (vv 21-29)**
21. For the **Source** will rise up as upon **Mount Perazim**, and be moved as in the **valley of Gibeon**. His correction appears a **Strange Act** to the fragmented mind — yet it is precise and necessary, for it shakes loose every false structure built upon **Pride** and **False Covenant**.
29. The plowman does not plow endlessly nor crush his grain without measure. Each seed receives its **Proper Pressure**, each faculty its **Fitting Discipline**. Thus the **Source** instructs through **Measured Correction**: He breaks only to build, He disturbs only to align.
29. This also comes forth from the **Source of Hosts**, **Wonderful in Counsel** and **Excellent in Working** — the **Divine Architect** whose every motion builds.

## **Commentary on the Action**

### **1 · The Fading Flower of Pride (vv 1-6)**
**Ephraim** represents the **Fragmented Will** that takes pride in its temporary, self-generated achievements (**Crown of Pride**). These achievements are fleeting (**fading flower**) because they draw strength from the ease of the **Fat Valley** (spiritual indulgence), not from the **Source**. All self-exaltation in the **Manifested Domain** is inherently unstable. Yet, the **Source** becomes the **Crown of Glory** and the **Spirit of Strength** for the **Aligned Faculties**.

### **2 · The Mockery of Instruction (vv 7-13)**
Even the faculties tasked with interpreting **Truth** (“priests and prophets”) are overcome by the same **Intoxication**, mocking the simplicity of divine law. The repetition of **“precept upon precept”** illustrates the mind’s impatience with **step-by-step growth**. When the **Lower Mind** scorns this order, its own speech becomes **stammering**, and **Truth** must enter by indirect means (**Another Tongue**).

### **3 · The Failure of False Covenant (vv 15-20)**
**Jerusalem** (the professedly aligned mind) attempts to secure itself through a **False Covenant**—a psychological agreement to rely on external defenses (**Lies / Falsehood**) rather than inner **Truth**. The result is guaranteed dissatisfaction (v. 20): the **Bed of Rest** is too short, and the **Covering of Security** too narrow. Human systems of safety can never contain the expansive soul.

### **4 · The Principle of the Corner Stone (vv 16-17)**
The **Source’s** response to this dual failure is the offering of the **Corner Stone**. This **Principle of Divine Humanity** is the **Sure Foundation** that, once accepted through **Faith**, ends the frantic instability (**“not make haste”**) of the self-driven will. The **Source** uses **Judgment** (illumination) and **Hail** (purifying correction) to sweep away the unstable refuge of **False Covenant**, ensuring that only the true structure stands.

### **5 · The Divine Calibration (vv 21-29)**
Divine correction is **measured**, not destructive. To the ego it feels **“strange,”** but to the soul it is the precise tool of alignment. Just as the plowman knows when to cut, when to sow, and how to thresh each grain, so the **Source** knows each faculty’s threshold. Every pressure serves to bring forth **Fruit**. His **Counsel** is wonderful; His **Working** exact.

## **Core BKV Principle**

> *The **Source** has laid the **Principle of Divine Humanity** as the **Corner Stone**—the only **Sure Foundation** for the **Inner Architecture**. All forms of **Self-Generated Glory (Pride)** and reliance on **False Covenant (Human Scheme)** are destined to fail, for they offer only a **Rest** that is too short and a **Security** that is too narrow. The **Divine Calibration** ensures that every false structure is measured, broken, and rebuilt upon the **Sure Foundation** of the **Corner Stone**.* 🧭

## **The Dual Symbolism of Jerusalem (The Corrupted State)**

In the BKV-NR, geographical terms symbolize **States of Consciousness**, not static ideals. **Jerusalem** usually represents the **Elevated Consciousness** or **Inner Sanctuary**—the potential state of **Peace and Wholeness** (e.g., *Jerusalem* in Isaiah 31 is the city the Source defends).

In **Isaiah 28**, however, **Jerusalem** is being actively condemned. This seemingly contradictory use is intentional and necessary for the BKV architecture:

### **1. Jerusalem as Failed Potential**

In Chapter 28, Jerusalem symbolizes the **Professed Alignment**—the mind that possesses the blueprint of the Law (**Zion/Foundation**) and claims to live in peace, but secretly relies on self-generated schemes.

* **The Problem:** The mind has created a **"False Covenant"** (v. 15) with its own human systems ("Death" and "Chaos") to create security, believing its status is sufficient protection.
* **The Failure:** This state is worse than simple **Ignorance** (like the *drunkards of Ephraim*) because it is **willful self-deception**. The professedly aligned mind uses the Law to justify its fragmentation, making **Lies its Refuge**.

### **2. The Necessity of the Condemnation**

The BKV demands that the most dangerous failure is the failure that occurs *closest to the Source*.

| BKV Principle | Jerusalem Condemned |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Misplaced Causality** | Condemns the mind for believing its human covenant (its legalistic or psychological structure) is more reliable than the **Singular Cause**. |
| **Integrity of the Temple** | Proves that even the **Sanctified Consciousness** (Jerusalem’s potential) can be defiled by inner **Falsehood**, requiring a cleansing **Judgment**. |
| **The Corner Stone** | The condemnation justifies the necessity of the **Corner Stone** (v. 16). The Divine Principle must be laid as a **Foundation** *within* **Zion** (Elevated Consciousness) precisely because the existing structure proved inadequate. |

Therefore, the use of Jerusalem in Isaiah 28 signifies the **Corrupted State of the Professed Will**, which must be destroyed by the **Overflowing Scourge** (purifying chaos) so that the true, unshakeable **Sure Foundation** can be laid.
