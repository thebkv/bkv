# 1 Corinthians 5 — BKV Study  
### *Corruption in the Community, the Leaven of the Old Self, and the Courage to Purify the Inner Life*

---

## **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

1. It is widely reported — shockingly —  
   that there is a form of **sexual immorality** among you  
   *not even seen among the nations*:  
   one has taken his **father’s wife**.

2. And you are **puffed up**,  
   instead of being grieved,  
   so that the one who has done this  
   should have been **removed** from your midst.

3. For though I am absent in body,  
   I am **present in spirit**,  
   and I have already judged —  
   as though present —  
   the one who has acted in this way.

4. When you are gathered together,  
   and my spirit with you,  
   **in the power of our Lord Jesus**,  

5. **deliver such a one to destruction of the flesh**,  
   so that the **spirit** may be saved  
   in the **Day** of the Lord.

## **The Leaven Principle**

6. Your boasting is not good.  
   Do you not know that **a little leaven leavens the whole lump**?

7. Purge out the **old leaven**,  
   that you may be a **new lump**,  
   even as you are **unleavened**.  
   For Christ, our **Passover**,  
   has been sacrificed.

8. Therefore let us keep the feast —  
   not with **old leaven**,  
   not with the leaven of **malice** and **wickedness**,  
   but with the **unleavened bread**  
   of **sincerity** and **truth**.

## **Clarifying the Boundaries**

9. I wrote to you previously  
   **not** to keep company with sexually immoral people —

10. **not** meaning the immoral of the world,  
    or the greedy, or swindlers, or idolaters —  
    for then you would have to leave the world entirely.

11. But now I write again:  
    do not keep close company with anyone  
    **who is called a brother**  
    yet is sexually immoral, greedy, an idolater, a reviler, a drunkard, or a swindler.  
    **Do not even eat with such a one.**

12. For what business is it of mine  
    to judge those outside?  
    Do you not judge those **within**?

13. God judges those **outside**.  
    Therefore:  
    **Remove the corrupting influence from among you.**

# **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**  
### *A Poetic Alignment with the Text*

- Corruption tolerated  
  becomes corruption multiplied.  

- The community cannot rise  
  higher than what it allows  
  to fester in its own heart.

- Deliver the flesh to destruction —  
  meaning:  
  let the old, diseased pattern  
  meet its end,  
  so the spirit may awaken.

- Leaven works quietly.  
  It expands.  
  It occupies.  
  It spreads through the whole man  
  if not removed.

- The Passover Lamb is slain,  
  and now the soul must sweep the house —  
  clearing out old motives,  
  old desires,  
  old patterns.  

- The world is not your battlefield.  
  Your own inner community is.  
  Judge the within,  
  release the without.

- Remove the corruption —  
  and the Temple becomes clear again.

# **Summary / Commentary**

1 Corinthians 5 is not simply “about church discipline.”  
It is one of the clearest BKV chapters in the entire letter —  
**a blueprint for how the inner life must deal with corruption.**

It reveals **four major truths**:

### **1. Corruption spreads unless confronted.**  
“Leaven” is the symbol of **quiet, subtle, inner decay**.  
What you tolerate becomes what you embody.

### **2. Delivering the flesh to destruction**  
is a metaphor for letting the **corrupted ego-pattern** collapse.  
This is not punishment —  
it is **spiritual surgery**.

### **3. The Passover imagery means:  
The Lamb has done His part; now the house must be cleansed.**  
Christ’s sacrifice provides the power;  
your work is to **sweep the inner rooms**.

### **4. Judge inside, not outside.**  
The world is not your responsibility.  
Your **inner community** —  
your thoughts, influences, patterns —  
*that* is where judgment belongs.

This chapter is fierce, clean, and necessary.  
No modern lens softens it —  
and it shouldn’t.  
Because it is teaching the soul  
**how to guard its holiness  
and maintain the purity of the inner Temple.**
