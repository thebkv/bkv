### **Questions About Marriage and Commitment**

1. Now concerning the matters you wrote about:  
   “It is good for a man not to touch a woman.”

2. Yet because of **unregulated desires**,  
   each man should have his own wife,  
   and each woman her own husband.

3. The husband must give to the wife  
   what is owed in affection;  
   likewise the wife to the husband.

4. The wife does not have authority over her own body,  
   but the husband does;  
   likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body,  
   but the wife does.

5. Do not deprive one another,  
   except by agreement for a season,  
   that you may devote yourselves to **prayer**;  
   then come together again,  
   lest the Adversary tempt you  
   because of your lack of self-control.

6. But I say this as a concession —  
   not as a command.

7. For I wish all were as I myself am;  
   but each has his **own gift** from God —  
   one after this manner,  
   and another after that.

### **To the Unmarried and the Married**

8. To the unmarried and the widowed I say:  
   it is good for them if they remain as I am.

9. But if they cannot govern their desires,  
   let them marry;  
   for it is better to marry  
   than to burn.

10. To the married I command —  
    not I, but the Lord —  
    that the wife must not depart from her husband.

11. But if she does depart,  
    let her remain unmarried  
    or be reconciled to her husband.  
    And the husband must not put away his wife.

---

### **Mixed Belief Households**

12. To the rest I say —  
    not the Lord —  
    that if a brother has an unbelieving wife  
    and she is willing to dwell with him,  
    he should not put her away.

13. And if a woman has an unbelieving husband  
    and he is willing to dwell with her,  
    let her not leave him.

14. For the unbelieving husband is made **set apart**  
    through the wife,  
    and the unbelieving wife  
    is made **set apart**  
    through the husband.  
    Otherwise your children would be unclean;  
    but now they are **holy**.

15. But if the unbelieving departs,  
    let them depart.  
    A brother or sister  
    is not bound in such cases.  
    God has called us to **peace**.

16. For how do you know, wife,  
    whether you will save your husband?  
    Or how do you know, husband,  
    whether you will save your wife?

### **Calling and Contentment**

17. But as God has distributed to each,  
    as the Lord has **called** each,  
    so let them walk.  
    And this I order in all Assemblies.

18. Was a man called being circumcised?  
    Let him not seek to undo it.  
    Was he called uncircumcised?  
    Let him not seek circumcision.

19. Circumcision is nothing;  
    uncircumcision is nothing;  
    what matters is  
    **keeping the commands of God**.

20. Let each remain in the calling  
    wherein he was called.

21. Were you called being a servant?  
    Care not for it;  
    but if you can be free, use it.

22. For the servant called in the Lord  
    is the Lord’s **freedman**;  
    likewise the free man called  
    is Christ’s **servant**.

23. You were bought with a price —  
    do not become slaves of men.

24. Brothers,  
    let each one remain with God  
    in the state wherein he was called.

### **Concerning the Unmarried**

25. Now concerning virgins,  
    I have no direct command from the Lord;  
    but I give my judgment,  
    as one who has obtained mercy  
    to be faithful.

26. I think that, because of the **present distress**,  
    it is good for a person  
    to remain as they are.

27. Are you bound to a wife?  
    Do not seek release.  
    Are you loosed from a wife?  
    Do not seek a wife.

28. But if you marry, you have not sinned;  
    and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned;  
    yet such shall have trouble in the flesh —  
    and I would spare you.

---

### **The Shortness of Time and the Divided Heart**

29. This I say, brothers:  
    **the time is short**.  
    From now on,  
    those who have wives  
    should be as though they had none;

30. those who weep  
    as though they did not weep;  
    those who rejoice  
    as though they did not rejoice;  
    those who buy  
    as though they did not possess;

31. and those who use this world  
    as though not absorbed by it.  
    For the **form** of this world  
    is passing away.

---

### **Undivided Devotion**

32. I would have you free from anxiety.  
    The unmarried man  
    is anxious about the things of the Lord —  
    how he may please the Lord.

33. But the married man  
    is anxious about the things of the world —  
    how he may please his wife —  
    and his devotion is divided.

34. The unmarried woman or virgin  
    cares about the things of the Lord,  
    that she may be holy  
    in body and spirit.  
    But she who is married  
    cares about the things of the world —  
    how she may please her husband.

35. This I say for your own good —  
    not to trap you —  
    but so that you may serve the Lord  
    without distraction.

### **Regarding Engagement and Household Order**

36. If a man thinks he is behaving improperly  
    toward his betrothed,  
    and if her maturity demands it,  
    let them marry;  
    he does not sin.

37. But the one who stands firm in heart,  
    having no necessity,  
    but having control over his desires,  
    and has resolved  
    to keep her as she is —  
    does well.

38. So then,  
    he who marries his betrothed  
    does well;  
    but he who does not marry  
    does even better.

39. A wife is bound to her husband  
    as long as he lives;  
    but if he dies,  
    she is free to marry  
    whom she will —  
    but only in the Lord.

40. Yet she is happier, in my judgment,  
    if she remains as she is —  
    and I think that I also  
    have the Spirit of God.

# **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**  
### *Poetic Alignment*

- Desire must be governed,  
  or desire will govern you.

- Marriage is a covenant of mutual authority —  
  a mirror of the inner faculties  
  yielding to one another in love.

- Mixed households are the soul itself —  
  part-believing, part-unbelieving;  
  yet holiness spreads outward  
  when peace reigns within.

- Calling is not an escape,  
  but an assignment.  
  Remain where you were called —  
  God meets you there.

- Circumcision, uncircumcision —  
  all the outward marks  
  fade before  
  the obedience of the heart.

- Freedom and servanthood  
  are reversed in the Kingdom —  
  the free are servants,  
  and the servants are free.

- The time is short;  
  hold this world lightly.  
  Love deeply,  
  but cling to nothing  
  that is passing.

- Marriage is good.  
  Singleness is also good.  
  The question is not status  
  but **attention**.

- Serve the Lord  
  without distraction.

# **Summary / Commentary**

**1 Corinthians 7** is NOT primarily about marriage rules.  
It is a chapter about:

### **1. Attention.**  
Where does your energy go?  
What pulls you?  
What divides you?

### **2. Calling.**  
God meets each believer  
*where they already are*.  
The chapter breaks the spell  
of thinking your spiritual life  
requires changing external conditions.

### **3. Desire and Discipline.**  
Paul treats desire honestly —  
not as an enemy,  
but as something that must be governed  
to prevent spiritual scattering.

### **4. Holiness that spreads outward.**  
Mixed households become a picture  
of the soul's internal mixture —  
yet holiness is the active agent.

### **5. The passing form of this world.**  
A reminder to hold the temporary lightly  
and the eternal tightly.

### **6. Undivided devotion.**  
The true point of the chapter.  
Marriage is honorable.  
Singleness is honorable.  
Neither is superior —  
the question is **focus**.
