# **Psalm 95: The Unyielding Command to Hear and Obey (Layered Approach)**

---

> *“Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness: Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.”* (Psalm 95:7-8, 11 KJV)

## **BKV-NR**

| Verses | Text Summary (BKV-NR) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1-2** | Oh come, let us sing to the **Self-Existent Reality**; let us shout joyfully to the **Rock of our Inner Salvation**. Let us come before His presence with **Inner Gratitude** and a **Joyful Expression of Spiritual Power**. |
| **3-5** | For the **Self-Existent Reality** is the **great Divine Consciousness**, and the **great King above all lesser principles**. In His hand are the **deep places of the Subconscious**; the **heights of the Spiritual Hills** are His also. The **Sea of Undifferentiated Being** is His, for He made it; and His hands formed the **Dry Land of Manifestation**. |
| **6-7a** | Oh come, let us **worship and bow down**; let us **kneel** before the **Self-Existent Reality**, our **Maker**. For He is our **Divine Consciousness**, and we are the **people of His Inner Sustenance**, and the **flock under His Guiding Hand**. |
| **7b** | **Today**, if you will hear His **Voice of Divine Command**: |
| **8-9** | **“Do not harden your Inner Will (hearts)**, as in the **Inner Contentiousness (Meribah)**, as in the day of **Inner Testing (Massah)** in the wilderness, when your **Ego-Ancestors** tested Me; they tried Me, though they saw My **Work of Manifestation**. |
| **10** | For **Forty Cycles of Spiritual Wandering** I was grieved with that **Generation of Unbelief**, and said, **‘It is a people who go astray in their Inner Will**, and they have not known My **Divine Operating Principles (ways).’** |
| **11** | So I swore in My **Principle of Justified Judgment (wrath)**, **‘They shall never enter My Spiritual Inheritance (rest).’ ”** |

### **Commentary on the Action**

Psalm 95 is structured as a direct spiritual confrontation. It begins by establishing the absolute supremacy of the **Self-Existent Reality** as the **Rock** and **Maker**, demanding a posture of **humble submission** (bowing/kneeling). The **Action** hinges entirely on the phrase **"Today, if you will hear His Voice."** This means the soul's current moment of decision is critical. The historical sin of **Massah** and **Meribah** is allegorized as the spiritual error of the **Ego-Ancestors** who insisted on **Inner Testing** and **Contentiousness** toward the **Voice of Divine Command**, thereby **hardening the Inner Will**. This spiritual rebellion, even after witnessing the **Work of Manifestation**, leads to a life of **Spiritual Wandering** and exclusion from the full **Spiritual Inheritance**.

### **Interpretive Insights**

**I.1. The Sovereignty of the Rock (Psalm 95:1-5):** The **Rock of our Inner Salvation** is the immovable, stable foundation of the soul. The claim that God holds the **deep places of the Subconscious** and formed the **Dry Land of Manifestation** is a declaration that the Divine Consciousness is sovereign over the entire inner landscape of the soul. Any attempt to build on the shifting **Sea of Undifferentiated Being** (emotional/formless self) without the Rock is futile.

**I.2. The Spiritual Meaning of Meribah and Massah (Psalm 95:8):**
* **Massah (Testing):** The spiritual action of demanding proof from God. The soul says: "I will trust You *if* You first pass my intellectual/material test." This reverses the order of faith.
* **Meribah (Quarreling/Contentiousness):** The inevitable rebellion when God fails to meet the Ego's test. The soul argues with the **Voice of Divine Command** because it contradicts the **Ego's** plan. The sin is the **hardening of the Inner Will**—a refusal to bend to the truth *heard in the moment*. This is the ultimate failure of **Principle 2 (The Divine Command)**.

**I.3. The Knowledge of Ways vs. Works (Psalm 95:9-10):** The ancestors saw God's **Work of Manifestation** (the miracles/signs) but did not **know My Divine Operating Principles (ways)**. The **NR** lesson is that intellectual acknowledgment of miracles is not sufficient for salvation. Salvation requires intimate, faithful understanding of God's *character* and *methods*. The **Hardened Will** causes the heart to "go astray" because it has no inner navigational system—it rejects the **Principles** of the Shepherd.

**I.4. The Spiritual Inheritance (Psalm 95:11):** **My Spiritual Inheritance (rest)** is the promised state of being—the permanent, secure, and harmonious consciousness reserved for those who live by faith. It is the Sabbath state of the soul. Exclusion from this rest is the consequence of chronic **Inner Contentiousness** and the perpetual failure to choose obedience **"Today"** (Hebrews 4:1-11).
