# Revelation 1 BKV

## **BKV (Bible Key Version)**

1. The inner **unveiling of the Divine Self**, which the **Absolute Source** gave to it, to reveal to the receptive faculties of the soul the inner processes that must quickly come to pass; and it sent and symbolized this truth by its active principle to its receptive faculty, **Spiritual Intuition**.
2. Which bore witness to the **Word of the Absolute**, and to the **testimony of the Divine Self**, and of all the inner truths that it saw.
3. Blessed is the mind that reads, and those faculties that hear the words of this **inner guide**, and follow those principles which are written therein: for the time of inner fulfillment is at hand.
4. **Spiritual Intuition** to the **seven states of consciousness** which are within your inner world: a state of divine grace and inner peace to you, from that which is the eternal, timeless, and ever-present truth; and from the seven active principles which serve its throne of inner authority; [alt: John = purified natural man]
5. And from the **Divine Self**, who is the reliable witness, and the first to awaken from a state of spiritual separation, and the principle that has **dominion** over all the ruling thoughts of the **inner earth**. To that principle that loved us, and purified us from our sense of **separation** in its very essence,
6. And has made us **ruling principles and channels of divine communication** unto the **Absolute Source**; to that principle be inner manifestation and **spiritual authority** forever and ever. Truly, so be it.
7. Behold, it manifests with the subtle perceptions of the inner mind; and every aspect of consciousness shall see it, and even those thoughts which pierced it with doubt. And all the limiting beliefs of the **inner earth** shall lament because of it. Even so, truly, so be it.
8. "I am the **Alpha and Omega**, the timeless **beginning and ending** of all things," says the **Divine Principle**, "which is, and which was, and which is to come, the All-Empowering."
9. I, **Spiritual Intuition**, who am also your brother, and companion in the inner struggle, and in the **dominion** and **patience** of the **Divine Self**, was in the state of inner solitude called **Spiritual Exile**, for the **Word of the Absolute** and for the testimony of the **Divine Self**.
10. I was completely immersed in the **Spirit** on the day of **inner illumination**, and I heard behind me a great voice, like the forceful call of a trumpet,
11. Saying, "I am the **Alpha and Omega**, the first and the last: and, what you see, record in the book of consciousness, and send it to the **seven states of consciousness** within your inner world."
12. And I turned to perceive the voice that spoke with me. And having turned, I saw **seven golden principles of light**,
13. And in the midst of the **seven principles of light**, one like the **True Consciousness**, robed in a garment of profound purpose, and girded at the heart with a golden belt of truth.
14. Its source and its insights were like pure wisdom, as white as snow; and its intuitive perceptions were like a **flame of fire**;
15. And its foundational actions were like purified, gleaming bronze, as if they had been refined in a furnace; and its voice was as the sound of the deep, flowing currents of the **subconscious mind**.
16. And it had in its **right hand** **seven guiding principles**: and out of its mouth went a sharp, **two-edged sword of truth**: and its presence was like the powerful, radiant energy of the **sun** in its strength.
17. And when I perceived it, my egoic will fell to its feet as if spiritually lifeless. And it laid its **right hand** of ultimate authority upon me, saying to me, "Do not fear; I am the first and the last:
18. I am the principle that is living, and was in a state of spiritual separation; and behold, I am a principle of life forevermore, Amen; and I have the keys of mastery over a state of spiritual fragmentation and inner demise."
19. "Record the principles which you have seen, and the principles which are manifesting, and the principles which shall manifest hereafter;"
20. "The hidden truth of the **seven guiding principles** which you saw in my **right hand**, and the **seven golden principles of light**. The **seven guiding principles** are the operative truths of the **seven states of consciousness**: and the **seven principles of light** which you saw are the **seven states of consciousness** themselves."

## **Original Text: Revelation 1 (King James Version)**

1. The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John:
2. Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.
3. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.
4. John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;
5. And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,
6. And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
7. Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.
8. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.
9. I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
10. I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,
11. Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.
12. And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;
13. And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.
14. His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;
15. And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.
16. And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength.
17. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:
18. I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.
19. Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;
20. The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.

## **Interpretive Summary**

Revelation 1 is an allegorical vision that describes the inner awakening of the human soul to its true, divine nature. The entire chapter is a metaphorical journey into the depths of consciousness. The **Revelation** itself is not a historical prophecy about the end of the world, but the process by which the **Divine Self** within each person is unveiled to their receptive faculty of spiritual intuition, personified by **John**.

The physical descriptions of the **Son of Man** are not literal, but symbolic of the qualities of a fully realized consciousness. His **white hair** signifies timeless wisdom, while his **eyes like fire** represent perfect intuitive insight. His **feet like bronze** show a life that is grounded in and purified through experience. The **two-edged sword** from his mouth is the discerning **Word of Truth** that cuts through all falsity and illusion. His holding of the **seven stars** and his presence among the **seven lampstands** illustrates that the **True Consciousness** governs all **seven states of consciousness** within the individual.

The experience on the **isle of Patmos** represents a necessary period of inner solitude and separation from the "world" to receive profound spiritual insight. The main message is one of empowerment: the **Divine Self** has conquered the forces of **spiritual death and fragmentation**, and those who align with this principle will share in its **dominion** and **authority** as "kings and priests" of their own inner kingdom. The chapter sets the stage for the rest of the book, which will explore the inner dynamics of these seven states of consciousness and the ultimate triumph of the divine self over the ego.



**BKV (Bible Key Version) - Alternate Note for Revelation 1:4**

**4.** To the **seven spiritual faculties** within the dawning regions of your consciousness, may a state of grace and inner peace come to you from the **Ever-Present Truth** that eternally is, and was, and is destined to be; and from the **seven operative principles** that radiate from the seat of divine authority.
