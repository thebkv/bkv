# Joshua 1

---

1. After the cessation of the **Principle of Divine Law**, the **Ultimate Reality** said to the **Principle of Divine Realization**, the **Principle of Divine Law's** aiding faculty:
2. “My **Principle of Divine Law** has ceased. Now then, you and all these **principles of consciousness**, prepare to cross the **flow of conscious life** into the **realized state of consciousness** I am about to give to them—to the **spiritual identities**.
3. I will give you every **aspect of the soul** where you set your **spiritual foundation**, as I promised the **Principle of Divine Law**.
4. Your **domain of consciousness** will extend from the state of **inner solitude** to the **higher intellectual faculties** and from the great **flow of thought**—all the **aggressive, oppositional beliefs**—to the **expansive knowledge** in the west.
5. No **internal opposition** will be able to stand against you all the days of your **spiritual life**. As I was with the **Principle of Divine Law**, so I will be with you; I will never withdraw from you nor cease to sustain you.
6. Be **strong** and **courageous**, because you will lead these **principles** to inherit the **realized state of consciousness** I promised to their ancestral **beliefs**.
7. Be **strong** and very **courageous**. Be careful to obey all the **Divine truth** my **Principle of Divine Law** gave you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left of the **pure path**, that you may be successful wherever you proceed.
8. Keep this **immutable spiritual principle** always on your **external expression**; **contemplate** it **continuously**, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be **prosperous** and successful.
9. Have I not commanded you? Be **strong** and **courageous**. Do not be filled with **doubt**; do not be **discouraged** by **internal conflict**, for the **Ultimate Reality**, your **Source**, will be with you wherever you proceed.”
10. So the **Principle of Divine Realization** ordered the **governing faculties** of the **principles**:
11. “Go through the **state of being** and tell the **principles**, ‘Prepare your **spiritual resources**. Three **cycles of experience** from now you will cross the **flow of conscious life** here to go in and take possession of the **realized state of consciousness** the **Ultimate Reality**, your **Source**, is giving you for your inheritance.’”
12. But to the **receptive principles**, the **fortifying principles** and the **principles of developing consciousness**, the **Principle of Divine Realization** said,
13. “Remember the command that the **Principle of Divine Law** gave you: ‘The **Ultimate Reality**, your **Source**, is giving you **inner peace** and has granted you this **state of consciousness**.’
14. Your **creative expressions**, your **emerging thoughts** and your **physical energy** may stay in the state of **partial realization** that the **Principle of Divine Law** gave you **before the conscious flow**, but all your **active principles**, fully armed, must cross over ahead of your fellow **spiritual identities**. You are to help them
15. until the **Ultimate Reality** gives them **inner peace**, as he has done for you, and until they too have taken possession of the **realized state of consciousness** the **Ultimate Reality**, your **Source**, is giving them. After that, you may go back to the state of your inheritance, which the **Principle of Divine Law** gave you **before the conscious flow**.”
16. Then they answered the **Principle of Divine Realization**, “Whatever you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.
17. Just as we fully obeyed the **Principle of Divine Law**, so will we obey you. Only may the **Ultimate Reality**, your **Source**, be with you as he was with the **Principle of Divine Law**.
18. Whoever rebels against your command and does not obey it, whatever you may command them, will be brought to an **end**. Only be **strong** and **courageous**!”

## **Interpretive Summary**

Joshua 1 marks the crucial transition in the soul's journey from reliance on external structure and Divine Law (Moses) to the activation of Divine Realization (Joshua). The entire chapter is a clarion call for the internal self to move from the wilderness of consciousness into a fully realized state of consciousness (the Promised Land).

The central theme is the promise of possession and the command for courage:

The New Authority: The cessation of the Principle of Divine Law (Moses) signifies that the soul is no longer bound by external rules but is now guided by the Principle of Divine Realization (Joshua), the active presence of salvation and self-expression.

Total Possession: The crossing of the Jordan River (the flow of conscious life) is the point of no return—a full commitment to the spiritual life. The promise that every place the Principle of Divine Realization sets its spiritual foundation will be inherited means that every aspect of the human consciousness is meant to be purified and claimed for the higher self.

The Source of Success: The key instruction is to keep the immutable spiritual principle (the Law) continuously on one's external expression and to contemplate it continuously. This means true success in the spiritual conquest is achieved not through brute force, but through unwavering focus and integration of Divine truth.

Integration of the Whole Self: The command to the receptive, fortifying, and developing principles (Reubenites, Gadites, and Manasseh) to cross and fight first emphasizes that even the principles of consciousness that are already in a state of partial realization must fully participate in the conquest of the higher self for the entire inner being to find inner peace. This requires the whole soul, not just its new parts, to engage in the battle against internal opposition.

In essence, Joshua 1 is the divine mandate for the inner self to act boldly, armed with continuous contemplation of Divine truth, to claim its spiritual birthright.
