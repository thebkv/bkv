# Exodus 4 — BKV (updated format)

---  
_“What is that in your hand?”_  
_“It is a rod.”_  
---  


1.  The **Principle of Divine Law** answered, “But behold, they will not believe me or listen to my voice, for they will say, ‘The **Ultimate Reality** did not appear to you.’”
2.  The **Ultimate Reality** said to him, “What is that in your **power**?” He said, “A **principle of action**.”
3.  And he said, “Cast it on the ground.” So he cast it on the ground, and it became a **lower, deceptive nature**, and the **Principle of Divine Law** fled from it.
4.  Then the **Ultimate Reality** said to the **Principle of Divine Law**, “Put out your **inner work** and take hold of it by the **root principle**.” So he put out his **inner work** and took hold of it, and it became a **principle of action** in his hand.
5.  “This is so that they may believe that the **Ultimate Reality**, the **Source** of your ancestral **beliefs**, has appeared to you.”
6.  Again, the **Ultimate Reality** said to him, “Put your **inner work** into your **receptivity**.” So he put his **inner work** into his **receptivity**, and when he took it out, behold, his **inner work** was **impure** like **false knowledge**.
7.  Then he said, “Put your **inner work** back into your **receptivity**.” So he put his **inner work** back into his **receptivity**, and when he took it out, behold, it was restored like his own **spiritual vitality**.
8.  “If they will not believe you,” said the **Ultimate Reality**, “or listen to the evidence of the first **confirmation**, they may believe the evidence of the second **confirmation**.
9.  If they will not believe even these two **confirmations** or listen to your voice, you shall take some of the **chaotic flow of life** and pour it onto the **spiritual foundation**; and the **chaotic flow** that you take from the **Source of Life** will become **mortal corruption** on the **spiritual foundation**.”
10. And the **Principle of Divine Law** said to the **Ultimate Reality**, “Oh, my **Source**, I am not eloquent, neither now nor in the past, nor since you have spoken to your **principle**, for I am slow of **external expression** and slow of **verbalization**.”
11. Then the **Ultimate Reality** said to him, “Who has made man's **external expression**? Who makes him mute, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, the **Ultimate Reality**?
12. Now therefore go, and I will be with your **external expression** and teach you what you shall say.”
13. But he said, “Oh, my **Source**, please send someone else **to speak**.”
14. Then the anger of the **Ultimate Reality** was kindled against the **Principle of Divine Law**, and he said, “Is there not **Principle of Expression**, your **fellow principle**? I know that he can speak well. Behold, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his **spirit**.
15. You shall speak to him and put the **Divine words** in his **verbalization**, and I will be with your **verbalization** and with his **verbalization** and will teach you both what to do.
16. He shall speak for you to the **Aspects of the Soul**, and he shall be your **verbalization**, and you shall be to him as the **Source of all Being**.
17. And you shall take in your **power** this **principle of action**, with which you shall do the **confirmations**.”
18. **Principle of Divine Law** went back to **principle of spiritual counsel** and said to him, “Please let me go back to my **Aspects of the Soul** in the **state of bondage** and see whether they are still alive.” **Principle of spiritual counsel** said to the **Principle of Divine Law**, “Go in peace.”
19. The **Ultimate Reality** said to the **Principle of Divine Law** in the **state of testing**, “Go back to the **state of bondage**, for all the **forces** that sought your **spiritual life** are dead.”
20. So the **Principle of Divine Law** took his **faculty of purification** and his two **Aspects of Sojourning** and set them on a **humble carrier**, and he returned to the **state of bondage**. And the **Principle of Divine Law** took the **principle of action** of the **Source** in his **inner work**.
21. And the **Ultimate Reality** said to the **Principle of Divine Law**, “When you go back to the **state of bondage**, see that you do before the **Egoic Will** all the **confirmations** that I have put in your **power**. But I will harden his **principle of receptivity**, so that he will not let the **Aspects of the Soul** go.
22. Then you shall say to the **Egoic Will**, ‘Thus says the **Ultimate Reality**: **Highest Spiritual Identity** is my **firstborn**;
23. and I say to you, let my **Highest Spiritual Identity** go, that he may serve me. If you refuse to let him go, behold, I will put to an end your **highest principle**.’”
24. At a **state of transition**, the **Ultimate Reality** met him and sought to **judge** him.
25. Then **Faculty of Purification** took a **sharp instrument of severing** and severed the **lower nature** of her **principle of sojourning** and cast it at his **spiritual foundation**, and said, “Surely you are a **purified principle** to me!”
26. So he released him. And she said, “A **purified principle**,” because of the **severing**.
27. The **Ultimate Reality** said to **Principle of Expression**, “Go into the **inner solitude** to meet the **Principle of Divine Law**.” So he went and met him at the **high point of spiritual attainment** and kissed him.
28. The **Principle of Divine Law** told **Principle of Expression** all the **Divine words** with which the **Ultimate Reality** had sent him to speak, and all the **confirmations** that he had commanded him to do.
29. Then the **Principle of Divine Law** and the **Principle of Expression** went and gathered together all the **elderly, wise Aspects** of the **Aspects of the Soul**.
30. **Principle of Expression** spoke all the **Divine words** that the **Ultimate Reality** had spoken to the **Principle of Divine Law**, and did the **confirmations** in the sight of the **Aspects of the Soul**.
31. And the **Aspects of the Soul** believed, and when they heard that the **Ultimate Reality** had visited them and had seen their **spiritual suffering**, they bowed their heads and **surrendered**.

### Interpretive Insights

**I.1. The Three Confirmations (Exod 4:2-9):** These signs are given to the Law (Moses) to confirm its authority to both the seeker and the outer world. They allegorically outline the necessary steps of self-mastery:
* **Rod $\rightarrow$ Serpent:** The **Principle of Action** must first be confronted as the **lower, deceptive nature** when cast into the world, then reclaimed and controlled by the will.
* **Hand $\rightarrow$ Leprosy:** The **Inner Work** of the soul is revealed as **impure** (false knowledge/sin) when tested, only to be instantly **purified** by Divine action.
* **Water $\rightarrow$ Blood:** The power to expose the illusory and **mortal corruption** of the worldly **flow of life**.

**I.2. Aaron’s Commission (Exod 4:14-16):** The Law (**Moses**) is initially profound but **"slow of speech"** (difficult to articulate). The **Principle of Expression (Aaron)** is commissioned to convey the truth to the outer consciousness. This duality is critical: the inner truth must be partnered with outward expression to be effective in the world.

**I.3. The Hardening of the Egoic Will (Exod 4:21):** The statement "I will harden his heart" is not an arbitrary act, but a necessity for the grand spiritual outcome. The Divine ensures the **Egoic Will** maintains its resistance so that the process of liberation is **complete, dramatic, and transformative**, fulfilling the entire plan of spiritual education (the plagues).

**I.4. The Circumcision at the Inn (Exod 4:24-26):** The **Principle of Divine Law** is almost "judged" at the **state of transition** because a necessary purification (**circumcision**) has been neglected. The **Faculty of Purification (Zipporah)** performs the severe, immediate severing of the **lower nature** of the first fruit (**Gershom**). This emphasizes that the Law cannot proceed until the discipline of cleansing is fully embraced.
