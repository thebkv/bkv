## Matthew 2 (BKV Symbolic-Only Restatement)

1. After **Yahweh Saves** was born in _the_ **Place of God’s Nourishment** of Judea, in _the days of_ **Worldly Authority**, **Seekers of Wisdom** came from _the_ **Rising of Light** to _the_ **City of Peace**.  

2. They asked, “Where is the one born King of Praise’s people? For we saw his star at its rising, and we have come to honor him.”  

3. When _the_ **Worldly Authority** heard this, he was troubled, and all _the_ **City of Peace** with him.  

4. He gathered the religious leaders and scribes and asked where _the_ **Anointed** was to be born.  

5. They said, “In _the_ **Place of God’s Nourishment** of Judah, for the prophet wrote:  

6. ‘And you, **Place of God’s Nourishment**, in _the_ land of **Praise**, are by no means least among _the_ rulers; for out of you shall come a shepherd of my people.’”  

7. Then _the_ **Worldly Authority** secretly called _the_ **Seekers of Wisdom** and asked the exact time the star had appeared.  

8. He sent them to _the_ **Place of God’s Nourishment**, saying, “Go, search carefully for the child; and when you find him, bring me word, so that I too may honor him.”  

9. After hearing _the_ ruler, they went on their way, and the star they had seen at its rising went before them until it stopped over _the_ place where the child was.  

10. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with great joy.  

11. Entering _the_ house, they saw the child with his mother, and they bowed in honor. Opening their treasures, they presented gifts: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  

12. Having been warned in a dream not to return to _the_ **Worldly Authority**, they departed for their own country by another way.  

13. After they departed, a messenger of the Lord appeared in a dream to **Increase** and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, flee to **Bondage**, and remain there until I tell you; for _the_ **Worldly Authority** is about to seek the child to destroy him.”  

14. **Increase** rose, took the child and his mother by night, and withdrew into **Bondage**.  

15. They remained there until _the_ death of **Worldly Authority**, fulfilling what was spoken by the prophet: ‘Out of **Bondage** I called my son.’  

16. When _the_ **Worldly Authority** saw that he had been deceived by _the_ **Seekers of Wisdom**, he was enraged. He sent and killed all the male children in _the_ **Place of God’s Nourishment** and its surroundings, two years old and under, according to the time he had learned from _the_ **Seekers of Wisdom**.  

17. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet:  

18. “A voice was heard in **Height**, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for _her_ children; she refused to be comforted, because they are no more.”  

19. After _the_ **Worldly Authority** died, a messenger of the Lord appeared in a dream to **Increase** in **Bondage**, saying:  

20. “Rise, take the child and his mother, and go into _the_ land of God’s people, for those who sought the child’s life are dead.”  

21. **Increase** rose, took the child and his mother, and entered _the_ land of God’s people.  

22. But hearing that _the_ **Ruler of the People** reigned in Judea in place of his father, _the_ **Worldly Authority**, he was afraid to go there. Being warned in a dream, he withdrew into _the_ region of Galilee.  

23. He came and lived in a city called **Branch**, so that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled: “He shall be called a Nazarene.”
