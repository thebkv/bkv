# 1 Corinthians 3 — BKV Study    
### *The Infant Mind, the Inner Temple, and the Quality of the Work*

---

## **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

1. Brothers and sisters — when I first addressed you,  
   I could not speak to you as **spiritual** (awakened),  
   but as **carnal** — infants still shaped by the lower nature.  

2. I fed you with **milk**, not solid food,  
   for you were **not yet able** to receive deeper things.  
   Even now, many of you still struggle to bear them.

3. For where there is **envy**, **strife**, and **faction**,  
   are you not still **walking as ordinary men**,  
   operating from the lower consciousness?

4. One says, *“I am of Paul,”*  
   another, *“I am of Apollos.”*  
   This is the **ego dividing itself**,  
   clinging to personalities instead of the Source.

---

## **The Workers and the Field**

5. What then is Paul? What is Apollos?  
   Merely **servants** — instruments through whom you believed,  
   each fulfilling the task assigned by the Source.

6. **I planted, Apollos watered — but God gave the increase.**  
   Therefore neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything,  
   but the **Source who gives the growth**.

8. The one who plants and the one who waters are **one**,  
   and each will receive his own reward  
   according to the **quality of his labor**.

9. For we are **co-workers with God** —  
   you are **God’s field**,  
   and you are **God’s building**.

---

## **The Foundation and the Fire-Test**

10. As a **wise master-builder**,  
    I laid the **Foundation**,  
    and another builds upon it.

    But let every builder take **care** how he builds.

11. For no one can lay any **other foundation**  
    than the one already laid:  
    **Jesus Christ** — the pattern, the cornerstone.

12. If anyone builds upon this foundation  
    with **gold, silver, precious stones**,  
    or with **wood, hay, stubble** —

13. **Every work shall be tested by fire.**  
    That **Day** will reveal it,  
    for the **fire** will expose the quality of each person’s building.

14. If the work survives, he will receive a **reward**.  
15. If it burns, he will **suffer loss**,  
    yet he himself shall be **saved**,  
    **as one escaping through flame**.

---

## **The Inner Temple**

16. Do you not know that **you are the Temple of God**  
    and that the **Spirit of God dwells within you**?

17. If anyone **corrupts** the Temple of God,  
    God will dismantle that corruption.  
    For the Temple of God is **holy**,  
    and **you are that Temple**.

---

## **The Folly of the Lower Mind**

18. Let no one deceive himself.  
    If anyone among you thinks he is **wise** according to this age,  
    let him become a **fool**,  
    that he may become **truly wise**.

19. For the wisdom of this age is **foolishness** with God.  
    “He catches the wise in their craftiness,” it is written.

20. And again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise —  
    that they are vain.”

---

## **All Things Are Yours**

21. Therefore let no one boast in men.  

22. For **all things are yours** —  
    Paul, Apollos, Cephas,  
    the world, life, death,  
    things present, things to come —  
    **all are yours**,  

23. and **you are Christ’s**,  
    and **Christ is God’s**.

# **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**  
### *A Poetic Alignment with the Text*

- Milk for infants,  
  solid food for the awakened —  
  but both from the same Source.  

- Envy and strife are the fingerprints  
  of a mind still split in two.  

- The workers are nothing.  
  The growth is everything.  
  The field is the soul.  
  The builder is the will.  
  The Foundation is Christ.  

- Gold and silver endure.  
  Straw and stubble burn.  
  The **fire is mercy**,  
  revealing what is real  
  and removing what is false.

- There is a Temple inside you  
  not made with hands —  
  not built with argument,  
  but with alignment.

- The lower mind boasts.  
  The higher mind receives.  
  For everything is already yours  
  because you belong to Christ,  
  who lives in God.

# **Summary / Commentary**

1 Corinthians 3 explains *why* Corinth was spiritually stuck —  
they were **infants** because they were still **dividing** themselves by ego, personality, and preference.

Paul responds with three massive revelations:

### **1. Growth comes from God alone.**  
Human teachers are tools — not the Source.

### **2. Christ is the only true foundation.**  
Everything you build must align with Him.  
All other structures burn.

### **3. You are the Temple.**  
The Spirit is not far away —  
He resides at the center of the soul.  
Corruption is dismantled not to destroy you,  
but to cleanse the dwelling place.

### **4. All things are yours.**  
Not someday — now.  
Because you belong to Christ,  
who belongs to God.
