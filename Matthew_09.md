#Matthew09

## Chapter 9 Key Notes
- **Released Debts** — Forgiveness, lifting the weight of sin; paralysis = being bound.  
- **Religious Separatists** — Teachers clinging to form and status (scribes/Pharisees).  
- **Dishonoring God** — Claiming divine authority falsely (blasphemy).  
- **Inner Reasonings of the Heart** — Hidden judgments and motives (thoughts).  
- **Corrupt Judgment** — Twisted discernment (evil in hearts).  
- **Reborn Humanity (Son of Man)** — Frailty → restoration → glory; humanity restored in Christ.  
- **Heaven-backed Authority** — True divine power to act.  
- **The Source of Joy and Renewal** — Christ as covenant presence, reason for celebration.  
- **New Creation** — God’s new life, not containable in old forms.  
- **Restored Daughter** — Death overturned by touch.  
- **Hem of Garment** — Faith’s contact with Christ’s life draws power.  
- **Sight Restored** — Inner perception renewed.  
- **Speech Restored** — Freedom to proclaim God’s works.  
- **Sheep without a Shepherd** — Lost humanity without guidance.

## Matthew 9 (BKV Fully Symbolic Restatement)

1. Crossing over, Jesus came into *his own city*.  

2. They brought to him one **bound and unable to move forward**. Seeing their **faith**, Jesus said, “Take heart, child; your **debts are released**.”  

3. Some of the **religious separatists** said within themselves, “This is **dishonoring God**.”  

4. Jesus, knowing their **inner reasonings of the heart**, said, “Why do you turn to **corrupt judgment** within yourselves?  

5. Which is easier—to say, ‘Your **debts are released**, or to say, ‘Rise and walk’?  

6. But so that you may know that **Reborn Humanity** has **heaven-backed authority** on earth to forgive—he said to the one bound—‘Rise, take up your **bed**, and go home.’”  

7. And he rose and went.  

8. The **crowds were filled with awe**, glorifying God who had given such **authority to humanity**.  

---

9. Passing on, Jesus saw Matthew (**Gift of Yahweh**) at the **tax booth** and said, “Follow me.” He rose and followed.  

10. As Jesus reclined at table in the **house**, many **debt-collectors** and **sinners** came and sat with him and his **followers**.  

11. When the **religious separatists** saw this, they said, “Why does your **teacher** eat with **debt-collectors** and **sinners**?”  

12. Jesus answered, “It is not the **whole** who need a **physician**, but the **sick**.  

13. Learn what this means: **I desire mercy, not sacrifice.** For I came not to call the **self-righteous**, but those in **need**.”  

---

14. Then the **disciples of John (Yahweh is Gracious)** asked, “Why do we and the **religious separatists** fast, but your disciples do not?”  

15. Jesus said, “Can the **guests** mourn while **the Source of Joy and Renewal** is with them? Days will come when the **Source** is taken away, and then they will fast.  

16. No one **sews** a **new piece** onto an **old garment**, for the **tear** grows worse.  

17. Neither is **New Creation** poured into **old skins**. If it is, the skins **burst**, the **life** is spilled, and both are lost. **New Creation** must be placed into **fresh skins**, and then both are preserved.”  

---

18. As he was speaking, a **synagogue ruler** knelt before him, saying, “My **daughter** has just died. Come, lay your **hand** on her, and she will **live**.”  

19. Jesus rose and went with him, his **disciples** following.  

20. A **woman** who had suffered twelve years with a **flow of blood** came behind and touched the **Hem of his Garment**,  

21. saying, “If I only **touch**, I will be **made whole**.”  

22. Jesus turned, saw her, and said, “Take heart, **daughter**; your **faith** has made you **whole**.” And instantly she was **healed**.  

23. Coming to the **ruler’s house**, he saw the **mourners** and **musicians**.  

24. He said, “Go away, for the **girl** is not dead but **sleeping**.” And they **laughed**.  

25. But when the **crowd** was sent out, he went in, took her by the **hand**, and she **arose**.  

26. And **news** spread throughout the **land**.  

---

27. As Jesus passed on, two **blind men** followed, crying, “Have **mercy** on us, Son of **Beloved (David)**.”  

28. He asked, “Do you believe I am **able** to do this?” They said, “Yes, Lord.”  

29. Then he **touched** their **eyes**: “According to your **faith**, be it to you.”  

30. Their **eyes were opened**. Jesus warned them sternly, “Tell no one.”  

31. But they **spread** his **fame** everywhere.  

---

32. As they went, a **mute man** oppressed by an **Oppressive Force** was brought to him.  

33. When the **force** was cast out, the **mute spoke**. The **crowds marveled**, “Never has this been seen in **the Struggling Ones**.”  

34. But the **religious separatists** said, “He casts out **forces** by the **prince of forces**.”  

---

35. Jesus went through all the **towns** and **villages**, teaching, proclaiming the good news of the **Reign**, and healing every **disease** and **affliction**.  

36. Seeing the **crowds**, he was moved with **compassion**, for they were like **Sheep without a Shepherd**.  

37. He said to his **followers**, “The **harvest** is abundant, but the **workers** few.  

38. Pray the **Lord of the harvest** to send out **workers** into his **harvest**.”
