#Matthew09

## Chapter 9 Key Notes
- **Authority to Forgive** — Reborn Humanity is not bound by debt but releases it. Paralysis pictures being stuck, unable to move forward.  
- **The Struggling Ones (Israel)** — Those named as God’s people but still wrestling.  
- **Reborn Humanity (Son of Man)** — The pattern of frailty → restoration → glory; humanity as it is meant to be.  
- **The Source of Joy and Renewal** — Christ as presence, covenant fulfillment, and reason for celebration.  
- **New Cloth / New Wine** — New creation cannot be contained by old forms.  
- **Daughter Restored** — Death overturned by touch.  
- **Hem of Garment** — Faith reaches into Christ’s life to draw power.  
- **Blind / Sight** — Inner perception restored.  
- **Mute / Speech Restored** — Freedom to proclaim God’s works.  
- **Sheep without Shepherd** — Lost humanity in need of guidance.  
- **Harvest** — Humanity ready to be gathered into restoration.

## Matthew 9 (BKV Symbolic-Only Restatement)

1. Crossing over, Jesus came into his own city.  

2. They brought to him one paralyzed, unable to move. Seeing their faith, Jesus said, “Take heart, child; your debts are released.”  

3. Some of the teachers thought, “This is blasphemy.”  

4. Jesus knew their thoughts and said, “Why do you dwell on evil?  

5. Which is easier—to say, ‘Your debts are released,’ or, ‘Rise and walk’?  

6. But so that you may know that **Reborn Humanity** has authority on earth to forgive—he said to the paralyzed one—‘Rise, take up your bed, and go home.’”  

7. And he rose and went.  

8. The crowds marveled, glorifying God who had given such authority to humanity.

9. Passing on, Jesus saw Matthew at the tax booth and said, “Follow me.” He rose and followed.  

10. At table in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came and reclined with him.  

11. The Pharisees asked, “Why does your teacher eat with sinners?”  

12. Jesus answered, “It is not the well who need a physician, but the sick.  

13. Learn what this means: *I desire mercy, not sacrifice.* I came to call not the righteous, but sinners.”  

---

14. Then John’s disciples asked, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?”  

15. Jesus said, “Can the guests mourn while **the Source of Joy and Renewal** is with them? Days will come when he is taken away, and then they will fast.  

16. No one puts new cloth on an old garment, for it tears worse.  

17. Neither is **New Wine** poured into old skins. If it is, they burst. New wine is placed into fresh skins, and both are preserved.”  

---

18. As he spoke, a ruler knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has died. Come, lay your hand on her, and she will live.”  

19. Jesus rose and went, his disciples with him.  

20. A woman suffering twelve years with a flow of blood came behind and touched the **Hem of his Garment**,  

21. saying to herself, “If I only touch his garment, I will be made whole.”  

22. Jesus turned, saw her, and said, “Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you whole.” And she was healed instantly.  

23. Entering the ruler’s house, he saw the mourners.  

24. He said, “Go away, for the girl is not dead but sleeping.” They laughed.  

25. But he entered, took her hand, and she rose.  

26. News spread through all that land.  

---

27. As Jesus went, two blind men followed, crying, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”  

28. He asked, “Do you believe I am able to do this?” They said, “Yes, Lord.”  

29. He touched their eyes: “According to your faith, be it to you.”  

30. Their eyes were opened. He warned them, “See that no one knows.”  

31. But they spread his fame everywhere.  

---

32. As they went out, a mute man oppressed by an **Oppressive Force** was brought to him.  

33. When the force was cast out, the mute spoke. The crowds marveled, “Never has this been seen in **the Struggling Ones**.”  

34. But the Pharisees said, “He casts out forces by the prince of forces.”  

---

35. Jesus went through all cities and villages, teaching, proclaiming the good news of the **Reign**, and healing every disease and affliction.  

36. Seeing the crowds, he had compassion, for they were like **Sheep without a Shepherd**.  

37. He said, “The harvest is abundant, but the laborers few.  

38. Pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.”
