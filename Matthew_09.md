#Matthew09

## Chapter 9 Key Notes
- **Released Debts** — Forgiveness sets humanity free; paralysis = bound, unable to move.  
- **The Struggling Ones (Israel)** — Those named as God’s people but still wrestling.  
- **Reborn Humanity (Son of Man)** — Frailty → restored → crowned with glory; humanity as it is meant to be.  
- **The Source of Joy and Renewal** — Christ as covenant presence and reason for celebration.  
- **New Creation** — God’s new life cannot be contained by old forms.  
- **Restored Daughter** — Death overturned by touch.  
- **Hem of Garment** — Faith’s contact with Christ’s life draws power.  
- **Sight Restored** — Inner perception renewed.  
- **Speech Restored** — Proclamation loosed after oppression.  
- **Sheep without a Shepherd** — Lost humanity without guidance.  
- **Harvest** — Humanity ready for restoration.

## Matthew 9 (BKV Symbolic-Only Restatement, Full Meanings)

1. Crossing over, Jesus came into his own city.  

2. They brought to him one paralyzed, unable to move forward. Seeing their faith, Jesus said, “Take heart, child; your debts are released.”  

3. Some of the religious teachers thought, “This is blasphemy.”  

4. Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you dwell on evil?  

5. Which is easier—to say, ‘Your debts are released,’ or, ‘Rise and walk’?  

6. But so that you may know that **Reborn Humanity** has authority on earth to forgive—he said to the paralyzed one—‘Rise, take up your bed, and go home.’”  

7. And he rose and went.  

8. The crowds marveled, glorifying God who had given such authority to humanity.

9. Passing on, Jesus saw Matthew at the tax booth and said, “Follow me.” He rose and followed.  

10. As Jesus reclined at table in the house, many debt-collectors and sinners came and sat with him and his followers.  

11. When the Separatists said, “Why does your teacher eat with debt-collectors and sinners?”  

12. Jesus answered, “It is not the whole who need a physician, but the sick.  

13. Learn what this means: *I desire mercy, not sacrifice.* For I came not to call the self-righteous but those in need.”  

---

14. Then the disciples of John asked, “Why do we and the Separatists fast, but your disciples do not?”  

15. Jesus said, “Can the guests mourn while **the Source of Joy and Renewal** is with them? Days will come when the Source is taken away, and then they will fast.  

16. No one sews a new piece onto an old garment, for it tears worse.  

17. Neither is **New Creation** poured into old skins. If it is, the skins burst, the life is spilled, and both are lost. **New Creation** must be placed into fresh skins, and then both are preserved.”

18. As he was speaking, a synagogue ruler knelt before him, saying, “My daughter has just died. Come, lay your hand on her, and she will live.”  

19. Jesus rose and went with him, his disciples following.  

20. A woman who had suffered twelve years with a flow of blood came behind and touched the **Hem of his Garment**,  

21. saying, “If I only touch his garment, I will be made whole.”  

22. Jesus turned, saw her, and said, “Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you whole.” And instantly she was healed.  

23. Coming to the ruler’s house, he saw the mourners and musicians.  

24. He said, “Go away, for the girl is not dead but sleeping.” And they laughed.  

25. But when the crowd was sent out, he went in, took her by the hand, and she arose.  

26. And news spread throughout the land.  

---

27. As Jesus passed on, two blind men followed, crying, “Have mercy on us, Son of David.”  

28. He asked, “Do you believe I can do this?” They said, “Yes, Lord.”  

29. He touched their eyes: “According to your faith, be it to you.”  

30. Their eyes were opened. Jesus warned them sternly, “Tell no one.”  

31. But they spread his fame everywhere.  

---

32. As they went, a mute man oppressed by an **Oppressive Force** was brought to him.  

33. When the force was cast out, the mute spoke. The crowds marveled, “Never has this been seen in **the Struggling Ones**.”  

34. But the Separatists said, “He casts out forces by the prince of forces.”  

---

35. Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching, proclaiming the good news of the **Reign**, and healing every disease and affliction.  

36. Seeing the crowds, he was moved with compassion, for they were like **Sheep without a Shepherd**.  

37. He said to his followers, “The harvest is abundant, but the workers are few.  

38. Pray the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”
