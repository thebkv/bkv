Matthew 1 (BKV Restatement)
	1.	This is the record of Jesus the Christ — the saving presence of God — descended through Love, David, and through Faith, Abraham.
	2.	Faith, Abraham, fathered Isaac; Isaac fathered Jacob; Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers.
	3.	Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar; Perez fathered Hezron; Hezron fathered Ram.
	4.	Ram fathered Amminadab; Amminadab fathered Nahshon; Nahshon fathered Salmon.
	5.	Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab; Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth; Obed fathered Jesse.
	6.	Jesse fathered Love, David the king; David fathered Peace, Solomon, by the woman who had been the wife of Uriah.

7–11. From Peace, Solomon, the line continued through kings until the exile to Babylon.

12–16. After the exile, the line continued until Joseph, Increase, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, who is called the Christ.
	17.	So all the generations from Faith, Abraham, to Love, David, were fourteen; from Love, David, to the exile fourteen; and from the exile to the Christ, fourteen.
	18.	The birth of Jesus the Christ happened this way: Mary, pledged to Joseph, was found with child through the Holy Spirit before they came together.
	19.	Joseph, being just and unwilling to disgrace her, resolved to put her away quietly.
	20.	But as he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of Love, David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.”
	21.	“She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”
	22.	All this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet:
	23.	“Behold, the virgin will conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel” — which means, “God with us.”
	24.	When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel commanded him and took Mary as his wife.
	25.	But he did not know her until she had borne a son, and he called his name Jesus.
