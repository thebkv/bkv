# 1 Corinthians 10 — BKV Study  
### *Exodus as Inner Blueprint, Idolatry as Misalignment, and the Architecture of Participation*

---

# **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

### **The Wilderness as the Prototype of the Inner Life**

1. Moreover, brothers,  
   I do not want you to be ignorant  
   that **all our fathers** were under the cloud,  
   and all passed through the sea,

2. and were all **baptized into Moses**  
   in the cloud and in the sea;

3. and all **ate the same spiritual food**;

4. and all **drank the same spiritual drink**;  
   for they drank from the **spiritual Rock**  
   that followed them,  
   and that Rock was Christ.

5. But with most of them,  
   God was not well pleased,  
   for they were **overthrown**  
   in the wilderness.

---

### **Why These Stories Exist**

6. Now these things became **examples**,  
   to the intent that we should not desire evil  
   as they did.

7. Do not become **idolaters**,  
   as some of them were;  
   as it is written,  
   “The people sat down to eat and drink,  
   and rose up to play.”

8. Neither let us **commit immorality**,  
   as some of them did,  
   and in one day  
   twenty-three thousand fell.

9. Neither let us **test Christ**,  
   as some of them tested Him,  
   and were destroyed by serpents.

10. Nor **grumble**,  
    as some of them did,  
    and were destroyed by the destroyer.

11. Now all these things happened to them  
    as **patterns**,  
    and they are written  
    for our **instruction**,  
    upon whom the **end of the ages** has come.

---

### **Warning and Assurance**

12. Therefore let the one who thinks he stands  
    take heed,  
    lest he fall.

13. No testing has overtaken you  
    except what is common to man;  
    and God is faithful —  
    who will not allow you to be tested  
    beyond what you are able,  
    but will with the testing  
    also make the **way of escape**,  
    that you may be able to bear it.

---

### **Participation and the Table**

14. Therefore, my beloved,  
    flee from **idolatry**.

15. I speak as to sensible people;  
    judge for yourselves what I say.

16. The **cup of blessing** that we bless —  
    is it not a **participation**  
    in the blood of Christ?  
    The **bread** that we break —  
    is it not a **participation**  
    in the body of Christ?

17. For we, being many,  
    are **one bread**,  
    one body;  
    for we all partake  
    of the one bread.

---

### **Two Tables, Two Realities**

18. Observe Israel after the flesh:  
    those who eat of the sacrifices  
    are partakers of the altar.

19. What then am I saying?  
    That an idol is anything?  
    Or that what is offered to idols  
    is anything?

20. No —  
    but that what the nations sacrifice  
    they sacrifice to **demons**,  
    and not to God;  
    and I do not want you  
    to be **participants with demons**.

21. You cannot drink  
    the **cup of the Lord**  
    and the cup of demons;  
    you cannot partake  
    of the Lord’s table  
    and the table of demons.

22. Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy?  
    Are we stronger than He?

---

### **Freedom Guided by Edification**

23. All things are lawful,  
    but not all things are beneficial.  
    All are lawful,  
    but not all **build up**.

24. Let no one seek  
    his own advantage,  
    but the good of others.

25. Eat whatever is sold  
    in the marketplace,  
    asking no questions  
    for conscience’s sake;

26. for “the earth is the Lord’s,  
    and the fullness thereof.”

---

### **Practical Guidance**

27. If an unbeliever invites you  
    and you desire to go,  
    eat whatever is set before you,  
    asking no questions  
    for conscience’s sake.

28. But if someone says,  
    “This is offered in sacrifice,”  
    do not eat —  
    for the sake of the one who told you,  
    and for conscience;

29. not your own conscience,  
    but the other person’s.  
    For why is my freedom  
    judged by another’s conscience?

30. If I partake with thankfulness,  
    why am I spoken evil of  
    for that for which I give thanks?

---

### **Final Principle of the Whole Chapter**

31. Whether you eat or drink,  
    or whatever you do,  
    do all  
    to the **glory of God**.

32. Give no cause of stumbling  
    to Jews,  
    to Greeks,  
    or to the Assembly of God;

33. just as I please all men in all things,  
    not seeking my own benefit,  
    but the benefit of many —  
    **that they may be saved.**

# **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**  
### *Poetic Alignment*

- The wilderness  
  is the classroom  
  of the soul.

- The cloud,  
  the sea,  
  the manna,  
  the water,  
  the Rock —  
  all were signs  
  of inner realities.

- Desire misaligned  
  becomes idolatry.  
  Desire disciplined  
  becomes devotion.

- Testing God  
  is demanding control  
  instead of trusting His leading.

- Grumbling  
  is rebellion of the heart.

- The table you eat from  
  becomes the spirit  
  you participate in.

- There is a table of the Lord  
  — life, unity, blessing —  
  and a table of demons  
  — confusion, appetite, pride.

- Freedom is real,  
  but freedom without love  
  becomes a snare.

- God always provides  
  a way of escape.  
  Not exemption from testing —  
  but an exit  
  through it.

- Whatever you do —  
  large or small —  
  do it in the light  
  of His glory.

# **Summary / Commentary**

**1 Corinthians 10** is the **Exodus blueprint** for the inner life.

### **1. Israel’s history is the soul’s history.**
Every stage of the wilderness is a stage of you:

- cloud = guidance  
- sea = separation  
- manna = spiritual nourishment  
- water = revelation  
- Rock = Christ  
- rebellion = ego  
- serpents = consequences  
- grumbling = inner resistance  

### **2. Participation is real.**
This chapter is the heart of Paul’s mystical theology:

- eating = participation  
- tables = spiritual alliances  
- the cup = shared life  

You become like what you commune with.

### **3. Freedom is governed by edification.**  
Not “Can I?”  
but **“Does this build?”**

### **4. Every test comes with a doorway.**  
God does not remove testing,  
but He always provides an **exit path**.

### **5. Everything orbits the glory of God.**  
Eating, drinking, choosing, abstaining —  
the whole world becomes an altar.
