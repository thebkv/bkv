# John 16 BKV

## **BKV (Bible Key Version)**

1. These things I have spoken to you, that you should not be thrown off balance by a difficult inner process.
2. The outer forms of religion will cast you out of their traditions. Indeed, the time comes when a limited mind, in its desire for what it thinks is right, will believe it is serving the **Absolute Source** by suppressing you.
3. And the limited mind will do these things to you because it has not yet known the **Absolute Source**, nor the **True Consciousness**.
4. But I have told you these things, so that when the time comes, you may remember I spoke of them. I did not tell you this at the beginning, because my physical presence with you made a profound spiritual connection unnecessary.
5. But now I am leaving my physical form to go to the **Absolute Source** that sent me; and none of you are asking me, “Where does this inner process lead?”
6. But because I have spoken these things to you, a sense of inner turmoil has filled your hearts.
7. Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is essential for your spiritual growth that my physical presence departs, for if I do not go, the **Divine Vitality** will not be manifested within you. But if I complete this process, I will send it to you.
8. And when it has come, it will provide a clear and undeniable realization to the collective **consciousness of humanity** regarding **separation**, and **right alignment**, and **inner judgment**:
9. Of **separation**, because people do not trust and act upon the truth of my being;
10. Of **right alignment**, because I am returning to the **Absolute Source**, and you will not perceive me with your outer senses;
11. Of **inner judgment**, because the ruling principle of this limited world is now seen for what it is.
12. I have many more truths to show you, but you cannot integrate them now.
13. However, when the **Spirit of truth** is come, it will guide you into all truth. For it shall not speak from its own limited perspective; but whatever it receives, that shall it speak; and it will reveal the inner processes to come.
14. It shall glorify me: for it shall receive from my essence, and shall reveal it to you.
15. All that the **Absolute Source** has is within me: therefore I said that the **Divine Vitality** shall take of my essence, and shall show it to you.
16. For a little while, you will not perceive me with your outer senses; and again, after a brief period of inner turmoil, you shall perceive me, because I am returning to the **Absolute Source**.
17. Then some of the inner faculties said among themselves, "What is this that he says to us, 'For a little while, you will not perceive me: and again, after a little while, you shall perceive me: and, 'Because I go to the **Absolute Source**'?"
18. They said, "What is this 'little while'? We cannot grasp what he is saying."
19. Now the **Divine Self** knew that they were yearning for understanding, and said to them, "Are you inquiring among yourselves of what I said, 'For a little while, you will not see me: and again, after a little while, you will see me'?"
20. Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall feel a sense of inner loss and distress, but the egoic **consciousness of humanity** shall rejoice: and you shall be in inner turmoil, but your turmoil shall be turned into **joy**.
21. A state of inner change is like a **woman when she is in the labor of new creation**: she has pain, because her time has come. But as soon as the **new principle** is birthed, she no longer remembers the anguish, because of the **joy** that a new spiritual awareness has been born into her inner **world**.
22. And you now therefore have inner turmoil: but I will be present with you again, and your heart shall be filled with **joy**, and your **joy** no limited mind can take from you.
23. And in that day you shall no longer need to ask me anything. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you shall align with the **Absolute Source** in my name, it will be given to you.
24. Up to now you have not asked for anything in my name: ask, and you shall receive, so that your **joy** may be complete.
25. These things I have spoken to you in allegories; but the time comes when I shall no longer speak to you in allegories, but I shall reveal the **Absolute Source** to you plainly.
26. In that day you shall seek through an alignment with my name, and I do not need to say that I will intercede with the **Absolute Source** for you:
27. For the **Absolute Source** itself loves you, because you have loved me, and have aligned with the truth that I came forth from the **Absolute Source**.
28. I came forth from the **Absolute Source**, and am come into the **consciousness of humanity**: again, I am leaving the **consciousness of humanity**, and returning to the **Absolute Source**.
29. His disciples said to him, "Behold, now you are speaking plainly, and not in allegories."
30. "Now we are sure that you know all things, and that no one needs to explain anything to you. By this we align with the truth that you came forth from the **Absolute Source**."
31. The **Divine Self** answered them, "Do you now truly align with this truth?
32. Behold, the hour of inner trial is coming, indeed it is now upon you, that you shall be scattered, each faculty returning to its own limited way, and shall leave me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the **Absolute Source** is with me.
33. These things I have spoken to you, that in me you might have inner peace. In the **consciousness of humanity**, you shall have **inner struggle**: but be of good courage; I have overcome the **limited world of consciousness**."

## **Interpretive Summary**

John 16 is a profound psychological and spiritual guide for navigating the process of inner transformation. It describes the necessary **inner struggle** and subsequent spiritual rebirth. The departure of the physical presence of Jesus is not a literal farewell, but a metaphor for the surrendering of reliance on external spiritual forms and teachers. This is a crucial step, as it is the very act that allows the **Holy Spirit** or **Divine Vitality** to be fully manifested within the soul.

The **Holy Spirit** is presented as an internal principle of truth that will provide a clear and undeniable conviction about three key aspects of consciousness: **sin** (our separation from the Divine Self), **righteousness** (the True Self's right alignment with the Absolute Source), and **judgment** (the ultimate defeat of the egoic mind).

The emotional pain of inner transformation is likened to a **woman in travail**. The temporary **sorrow** felt by the spiritual faculties as they witness the "death" of the old self is an essential part of the birthing process. This pain is not meaningless; it is a necessary precursor to the great **joy** that comes when a new, awakened consciousness is born into the inner world.

The chapter culminates with a powerful promise of direct, unmediated communication with the Divine. When the individual aligns their will with the **Divine Self** ("asks in my name"), they are connected directly to the **Absolute Source** itself. The final message is one of triumphant empowerment: despite the inevitable inner **tribulation** that comes from living in a limited state of consciousness, the **Divine Self** has already conquered the forces of the ego, and we can rest in that inner peace.
