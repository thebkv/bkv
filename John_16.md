## BKV-NR (Natural Reading)

**Having delivered the initial warning regarding outer resistance and persecution (John 16:1-6), the Christ Principle pivots to explaining the fundamental, expedient necessity of His spiritual departure for the soul's ultimate inner development.**

7. Nevertheless I tell you the **Inner Truth**; It is expedient for you that **I** go away: for if **I** go not away, the **Principle of Indwelling Divine Reality (Comforter)** will not come unto you; but if **I** depart, **I** will send **Him** unto you.
12. **I** have yet many **Spiritual Utterances** to say unto you, but you cannot **Bear** them now.
13. Howbeit when **He**, the **Principle of Indwelling Divine Reality (Spirit of Truth)**, is come, **He** will **Guide** you into all **Inner Truth**: for **He** shall not speak of **His Own** limited perspective, but whatsoever **He** shall hear, that shall **He** speak: and **He** will show you **Things to Come**.
14. **He** shall **Glorify Me**: for **He** shall receive of **Mine**, and shall show it unto you.

### The Creative Agony of Transformation

20. Verily, verily, I say unto you, that you shall **Wail** and **Lament**, but the **Inner World** shall **Rejoice**: and you shall be **Sorrowful**, but your **Sorrow** shall be turned into **Inner Joy**.
21. **A state of inner change is like a woman in labor, birthing a new awareness; the anguish is forgotten in the joy of spiritual emergence (A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world).**
22. And you now therefore have **Sorrow**: but **I** will see you again, and your **Principles of Consecration (Heart)** shall **Rejoice**, and your **Inner Joy** no **Aspect** takes from you.

### Direct Knowing and Will-Alignment

23. And in that **Day** you shall ask **Me** nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, **Whatsoever** you shall ask the **Source** in **My Name** [i.e., **in full alignment with my essence**], **He** will give it you.
25. These **Spiritual Utterances** have **I** spoken unto you in **Allegories** [proverbs]: but the time comes, when **I** shall no longer speak to you in **Allegories**, but will unveil the **Source** **directly within your awakened awareness (plainly)**.
27. For the **Source** **Himself** loves you, because you have loved **Me**, and have **Believed** that **I** came out from **The Self-Existent Reality**.

### The Final Triumph

33. These **Spiritual Utterances** **I** have spoken unto you, that in **Me** you might have **Peace**. In the **Inner World** you shall have **Tribulation**: but **take heart; I have transcended the world of limitation and cleared the path before you (I have overcome the world).**

## Commentary on the Action

John 16 prepares the soul for the necessary **Inner Travail** that precedes **Spiritual Emergence**. The departure of the **Christ Principle** (ascension) is essential for the arrival of the **Principle of Indwelling Divine Reality (Comforter/Spirit of Truth)**, which acts as an **internal, receptive transmitter** of Divine Will. This **Indwelling Principle** guides the soul into **Inner Truth** by consistently referring all revelation back to the Christ Pattern.

The anguish of **Transformation** is likened to **Childbirth**, where the **Sorrow** of the process is immediately forgotten in the **Joy of Spiritual Emergence**. The chapter announces the shift from receiving **Symbolic Instruction (Allegories)** to **Direct Knowing** of the Source. This **Direct Knowing** is accessed through **Will-Alignment** with the Christ essence ("in my name"). The final command is to **Take Heart**, recognizing that the **Christ Principle** has already **Transended the World of Limitation**, securing the path for the soul's own ultimate victory.

## Interpretive Insights

**I.1. The Necessary Process of Travail (v. 7, 21):** The BKV highlights that the **Christ Principle's** presence in its *physical/historical* form must cease for the **Principle of Indwelling Divine Reality** to fully activate *internally*. This transition necessitates a period of **Creative Agony (Travail)**. The sorrow felt during this **Inner Change** is temporary; the spiritual law guarantees that the pain of the **Transformation Process** results in the **unforgettable Joy** of birthing a new, higher awareness.

**I.2. The Nature of the Spirit of Truth (v. 13):** The **Principle of Indwelling Divine Reality** is not an external oracle. The phrasing "He shall not speak of His Own limited perspective" establishes that this Principle is the **perfectly clear, receptive channel** within the soul. Its function is to **receive** the truth from the Source and **transmit** it directly into the consciousness of the soul, guiding it into all **Inner Truth**.

**I.3. The Transition to Direct Knowing (v. 23, 25):** The statement about no longer speaking in **Allegories** marks a spiritual maturity point. The soul moves past relying on **Symbolic Instruction** (parables, rituals) to a state where the **Source** is revealed **directly within its awakened awareness**. **This shift from indirect teaching to immediate spiritual comprehension is the enlightenment Paul prays for in Ephesians 1:18.** This **Direct Knowing** then informs the soul's **Will-Alignment** ("ask in my name"), where asking becomes less about petition and more about declaring alignment with the Divine Will.
