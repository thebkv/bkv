# Mark 11. The beginning of the good news about the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**, the **true human** and **Son of the Source of all Being**,
2. as it is written by the **prophetic voice**: “I will send a **principle of communication** ahead of you, who will prepare your way,”
3. “a **voice** of one calling in a state of **inner solitude**, ‘Prepare the way for the **Ultimate Reality**, make a clear path for him.’”
4. And so the **preparatory consciousness** appeared in a state of **inner solitude**, preaching a **purification** of the old ways for the **healing of estrangement**.
5. The whole **religious tradition** and all the **spiritual consciousnesses** went out to him. Confessing their **spiritual estrangement**, they were **purified** by him in the **flow of conscious life**.
6. The **preparatory consciousness** was clothed in a simple garment, with a simple belt around his core, and he subsisted on the most fundamental **truths** found in **inner solitude**.
7. And this was his message: “After me comes one more powerful than I, the most humble of whose **principles** I am not worthy to bend and serve.
8. I purify you with the **flow of conscious life**, but he will purify you with the **animating principle**.”
9. At that time the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** came from the **state of being of the humble** and was purified by the **preparatory consciousness** in the **flow of conscious life**.
10. Just as the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** was coming up out of the **flow**, he saw the **higher consciousness** being torn open and the **animating principle** descending on him like a symbol of peace.
11. And a **divine message** came from the **higher consciousness**: “You are my **Son**, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.”
12. At once the **animating principle** sent him out into a state of **inner solitude**,
13. and he was in the state of **inner solitude** for forty days, being challenged by the **force of opposition**. He was with the **untutored principles**, and **operative principles of Spirit** attended him.
14. After the **preparatory consciousness** was put in a state of **limitation**, the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** went into the **receptive state**, proclaiming the good news of the **Source**.
15. “The time has come,” he said. “The **mastery of the lower nature** of the **Source** has come near. Be purified and trust the good news!”
16. As the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** walked beside the **depths of the receptive mind**, he saw the principles of **receptive hearing** and **strength** casting a method into the **mind**, for they were seeking **truth**.
17. “Come, follow me,” the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** said, “and I will send you out to seek **human consciousnesses**.”
18. At once they left their old methods and followed him.
19. When he had gone a little farther, he saw the **overcomer** with the **divine grace** in a **vessel of consciousness**, preparing their methods.
20. Without delay he called them, and they left their **rich reward** in the **vessel** with the **worldly principles** and followed him.
21. They went to a **new state of consciousness**, and when the **inner rest** came, the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** went into the **community of thought** and began to teach.
22. The **human consciousnesses** were amazed at his **wisdom**, because he taught them as one who had **spiritual authority**, not as the **rigid, intellectual beliefs**.
23. Just then a **faculty** in their **community of thought** was possessed by a **fragmented principle**. It cried out,
24. “What do you want with us, **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** from the **humble state**? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the **Holy One of the Source**!”
25. “Be quiet!” said the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** sternly. “Come out of him!”
26. The **fragmented principle** shook the **faculty** violently and came out of him with a shriek.
27. The **human consciousnesses** were all so amazed that they asked each other, “What is this? A **new truth**—and with **spiritual authority**! He even gives orders to **fragmented principles** and they obey him.”
28. News about him spread quickly over the whole **receptive state**.
29. As soon as they left the **community of thought**, they went with the **overcomer** and **divine grace** to the home of **receptive hearing** and **strength**.
30. The **receptive hearing's** **faculty of inner connection** was in a state of agitated thought, and they immediately told the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** about her.
31. So he went to her, took her ability to act and helped her up. The agitated thought left her, and she began to serve them.
32. That evening after the passing of the day's worldly activity, the **human consciousnesses** brought to the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** all the **spiritually unwell** and those possessed by **fragmented principles**.
33. The whole **conscious being** gathered at the door,
34. and the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** healed many who had various **spiritual diseases**. He also drove out many **fragmented principles**, but he would not let the **fragmented principles** speak because they knew who he was.
35. Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** got up and left for a **solitary place of reflection**, where he communed with the **Source**.
36. The principle of **receptive hearing** and his companions went to look for him,
37. and when they found him, they exclaimed: “Every **human consciousness** is looking for you!”
38. The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** replied, “Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby **states of being**—so I can proclaim **wisdom** there also. That is why I have come.”
39. So he traveled throughout the **receptive state**, proclaiming **wisdom** in their **communities of thought** and driving out **fragmented principles**.
40. A **faculty** with a state of **spiritual corruption** came to him and begged him on his **lower nature**, “If you are willing, you can make me clean.”
41. The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** was filled with compassion and reached out his ability to act and made contact with the **faculty**. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!”
42. Immediately the state of **spiritual corruption** left him and he was cleansed.
43. The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** sent him away at once with a strong warning:
44. “See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show your purified self to the **established belief** and offer the **acts of surrender** that the **Divine plan** commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”
45. Instead, he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news. As a result, the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** could no longer enter a **state of being** openly but stayed outside in **solitary places of reflection**. Yet the **human consciousnesses** still came to him from everywhere.

## **Interpretive Summary**

Mark 1 is a rapid and action-oriented chapter that serves as a powerful introduction to the Consciousness-of-the-Divine and its immediate work within the soul. The swift pace of the narrative itself symbolizes the quick and authoritative nature of spiritual transformation.

The chapter begins by establishing the role of the preparatory consciousness (John the Baptist). His work in the wilderness (a state of inner solitude) is to call for purification and prepare the human consciousness for a higher truth. The act of purification with water is contrasted with the future purification with the animating principle, highlighting the difference between a simple cleansing of the old self and a full immersion in divine vitality. The descent of the animating principle and the affirmation from the Source confirms that the Consciousness-of-the-Divine is in perfect alignment with its nature.

The narrative then moves to a period of inner testing, where the Consciousness-of-the-Divine confronts the force of opposition in inner solitude. After this, the real work begins. The Consciousness-of-the-Divine calls its first principles to a new purpose. The call to "fish for people" symbolizes a shift from seeking spiritual truths for the self to using those methods to help other human consciousnesses awaken.

The core of the chapter focuses on the immediate and authoritative work of healing and cleansing the inner being. The casting out of the fragmented principle from the community of thought demonstrates the power of the new wisdom to confront and silence internal, destructive thought patterns. The healing of the fever and the numerous sick faculties at sunset symbolizes the Consciousness-of-the-Divine tending to the spiritual ailments that arise from the worldly mind. The final act of cleansing the spiritual corruption (leprosy) and the instruction to return to established belief highlights that the awakened self, even in its purified state, must still navigate the structures of its past, but now with a new, embodied wisdom. The final verses show that the truth of this transformative work cannot be contained, and even when the Consciousness-of-the-Divine retreats to solitary places of reflection, the human consciousnesses will still find it.
