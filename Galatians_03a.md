# Galatians 3 — The Law and the Promise
### *Faith fulfills what the Law began.*

---

## **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

O children of awakening, who has clouded your vision?  
The living Christ has already been revealed within you, crucifying the old self and raising the new.  
Was the Spirit’s life born in you by ritual and rule, or by hearing the inward word with faith?  
Having begun in inspiration, will you now seek completion through self-effort?

All your endurance, your lessons, your corrections—shall they end in emptiness?  
The One who works miracles within you does not do so by law, but by the living rhythm of trust.

Remember **Faithfulness (Abraham)**: he believed the Source, and that belief became his rightness.  
So it is with you. Those who live by faith are his true offspring.  
Through this same faith the blessing of divine life flows to every people,  
that through trust all may share the promise of Spirit.

For those who cling to outward law remain bound by its endless demand,  
but the Christ within has redeemed the soul from that curse—  
becoming one with our limitation to free us from it.  
Now the blessing of Faithfulness reaches even the untrained faculties of the heart,  
and the Promise of Spirit is received through trust.

A covenant once confirmed cannot be undone.  
The promise was given to Faithfulness and to the one Seed—the Christ-consciousness—  
not to many scattered seeds of self-effort.  
The law, coming centuries later, cannot cancel what Grace established.

Why then the law?  
It was given to expose the error, to guard the mind until the Seed should come,  
ordained through angelic mediators.  
The law served its season; the promise endures forever.

Form is not against promise, but it cannot impart life.  
The written word shows all under limitation,  
that the Promise might be received by faith in the Christ within.

Before faith awakened, we lived under the tutor of law,  
disciplined until we could perceive the inner Teacher.  
But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.  
For you are all children of God through trust in the living Christ.  
You who are immersed in Christ have clothed yourselves with His identity.  
There is no division—structured or unstructured, bound or free,  
masculine or feminine—for all are one life in Him.  
And if you belong to Christ, then you are the offspring of Faithfulness,  
and heirs of the eternal Promise.

## **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**

**1 – 3.** The chapter opens as a wake-up call. The soul that once walked by revelation is tempted to return to analysis, to trade grace for performance. Paul calls this *bewitchment*—a spell of the intellect over the spirit.  

**4 – 5.** Miracles, inspiration, and inner renewal never come by rule. They come by resonance—the hearing of faith. The Spirit operates through openness, not through enforcement.  

**6 – 9.** Abraham represents the prototype of spiritual trust. Before any system or priesthood existed, he believed the invisible and moved forward. His faith becomes the spiritual DNA of every awakened soul.  

**10 – 14.** The “curse of the law” is not divine wrath; it is the inevitable exhaustion of self-effort. Trying to fulfill perfection through form creates bondage. Christ absorbs that burden and dissolves it—transforming curse into blessing.  

**15 – 18.** Promise precedes performance. The covenant of grace stands before and above all structure. Law can clarify, but it cannot cancel a gift that originates in pure love.  

**19 – 25.** Law’s purpose is temporary tutelage. It exposes misalignment, maintaining order until consciousness matures enough to live by inner direction. Once faith dawns, external discipline yields to inward guidance.  

**26 – 29.** Faith unites all opposites. When the Christ-identity clothes the soul, every polarity—cultural, social, gendered—dissolves into the single life of God. In that realization, the inheritance promised to Abraham is fulfilled within: divine life consciously possessed.

### **Summary Insight**
Law is the scaffolding; faith is the finished structure.  
The promise given to Abraham lives on as the Christ within—the indwelling certainty that grace, not effort, perfects the soul.

# **Galatians 3 — The Law and the Promise**

| **Authorized (KJV)** | **BKV–NR (Symbolic Narrative Reading)** |
|:--|:--|
| **1.** O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you? | O forgetful souls of **Awakened Understanding (Galatia)** — who has cast a spell over you, that you would turn from living truth? For before your very perception, the **Christ-principle** has already been revealed and established within you, crucifying the old self. |
| **2.** This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? | Ask yourselves: did the **Breath of Spirit** come through external obedience, or through inner trust awakened by hearing divine truth? |
| **3.** Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? | Having started in **inspiration**, will you now attempt completion through outward form and effort? |
| **4.** Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain. | Was all your growth and endurance for nothing — if you now return to dependence on outer systems? |
| **5.** He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? | Does the One who flows through you with life and wonder do so by rules, or by the resonance of faith within? |
| **6.** Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. | Just as **Faithfulness (Abraham)** trusted **The Source**, and that trust itself was counted as harmony and right standing. |
| **7.** Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. | So understand this: those who live by **inner trust** are the true offspring of **Faithfulness (Abraham)**. |
| **8.** And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed. | The inner Word foresaw that all unformed faculties (the Gentiles) would be made whole through trust, and declared long ago that through **Faithfulness**, all levels of consciousness shall be blessed. |
| **9.** So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham. | Therefore, those living by **faith** share the blessing of **Faithfulness** itself. |
| **10.** For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them. | Those who depend on outer law remain under its burden, for the mind that strives by form cannot rest until it fulfills every letter — and thus never rests at all. |
| **11.** But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith. | It is clear: no self is made whole through regulation, for **the aligned soul lives by trust in divine reality.** |
| **12.** And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them. | Law deals in performance, not trust; whoever depends on deeds remains bound within their cycle. |
| **13.** Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree. | The **Indwelling Christ** has lifted us from that cycle of striving, taking upon Himself the very limitation of the form — showing that by entering our bondage, Spirit breaks it from within. |
| **14.** That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. | That the **Blessing of Faithfulness** might flow even into the natural faculties, so that the **Promise of Spirit** could be received through trust, not achievement. |
| **15.** Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto. | Even among human understandings, once a covenant is sealed, none can cancel or add to it; how much more eternal is the covenant of Spirit. |
| **16.** Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. | The promise was made to **Faithfulness (Abraham)** and to the one seed — **the Christ-consciousness** — not to many scattered seeds of self-effort. |
| **17.** And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. | The **inner covenant of grace**, established long before the giving of law, cannot be nullified by later commandments; form cannot cancel what Spirit ordained. |
| **18.** For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise. | For if divine inheritance came by rule, it would not be a gift. Yet **The Source** granted it to **Faithfulness** through pure promise. |
| **19.** Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. | Why then the law? It was introduced to expose misalignment — to keep the mind conscious of its need — until the **Christ-seed** awakened within; a temporary structure administered through higher messengers. |
| **20.** Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one. | A mediator exists only between two parties, but **God is one**, uniting both sides in Himself. |
| **21.** Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. | Is form opposed to promise? Never. The law is preparatory — but it cannot impart life. If it could, harmony would indeed come through law. |
| **22.** But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. | The written word shows all human faculties limited, that the **Promise of Life through the Christ-principle** may be received by those who trust. |
| **23.** But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. | Before **trust awakened**, the soul was kept in the discipline of rules — confined until consciousness could rise to direct faith. |
| **24.** Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. | Thus, the law served as a tutor, guiding the self toward **Christ-awareness**, where justification comes through faith rather than correction. |
| **25.** But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. | Once trust has matured, we no longer require the outer tutor; the inner Spirit governs from within. |
| **26.** For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. | For you are all offspring of **Divine Life**, born through inner trust in **Christ-consciousness**. |
| **27.** For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. | All who are immersed in the **Christ-awareness** have clothed themselves with that identity. |
| **28.** There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. | In that consciousness, all divisions dissolve — structured and unstructured, high and low, masculine and feminine — all are unified expressions of the same Spirit. |
| **29.** And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise. | And if you live as expressions of the **Christ-life**, then you are the true offspring of **Faithfulness (Abraham)** — inheritors of the eternal **Promise of Spirit**. |
