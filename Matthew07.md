#Matthew07

## Chapter 7 Key Notes
- **Judge** — To condemn or measure; warning against hypocrisy (*Matthew 7:1–5*).  
- **Speck / Beam** — Small vs large faults; symbolic of self-blindness.  
- **Dogs / Pigs** — Those unreceptive to holy things, trampling truth (*Matthew 7:6*).  
- **Ask / Seek / Knock** — Progressive persistence in prayer (*Matthew 7:7–11*).  
- **Good gifts** — God’s generosity as Father.  
- **Golden Rule** — “Do to others as you would have them do to you” — summation of Law and Prophets.  
- **Narrow Gate / Wide Gate** — Choice of difficult but true path vs broad destructive path.  
- **False Prophets** — Known by fruits; outward appearance vs inward reality.  
- **Good Tree / Bad Tree** — Inner nature produces outer result.  
- **House on Rock / House on Sand** — Obedience vs disobedience as foundation.  
- **Amazed at his teaching** — His words carried authority, not tradition.

## Matthew 7 (BKV Symbolic-Only Restatement)

1. Do not **Condemn**, so that you will not be condemned.  

2. For with the judgment you pronounce, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.  

3. Why do you see the **Speck** in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the **Beam** in your own?  

4. How can you say, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when the **Beam** is in your own?  

5. You **Mask-Wearer**, first take the **Beam** out of your own eye, then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s.  

6. Do not give what is holy to **Dogs**, and do not throw pearls before **Pigs**, lest they trample them and turn to tear you.  

7. Ask, and it will be given; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened.  

8. For everyone who asks receives, the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.  

9. Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?  

10. Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?  

11. If you, though evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask him!  

12. So whatever you wish others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the **Law and the Prophets**.  

13. Enter by the **Narrow Gate**. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to **Destruction**, and those who enter by it are many.  

14. But the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.  

15. Beware of **False Prophets**, who come in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.  

16. You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?  

17. So every **Good Tree** bears good fruit, but the **Bad Tree** bears bad fruit.  

18. A **Good Tree** cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a **Bad Tree** bear good fruit.  

19. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.  

20. Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.  

21. Not everyone who says, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the **Reign of Heaven**, but the one who does the will of my Father.  

22. Many will say on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, cast out demons, and do many mighty works?’  

23. And then I will declare, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’  

24. Everyone who hears these words of mine and does them is like a wise man who built his house on **Rock**.  

25. The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on **Rock**.  

26. Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them is like a foolish man who built his house on **Sand**.  

27. The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell — and great was the fall of it.  

28. When Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,  

29. for he taught them as one who had authority, not as their scribes.
