Matthew 1 (BKV Restatement)
	1.	This is the record of Jesus the Christ — the saving presence of God — descended through Love and through Faith.
	2.	Faith gave rise to Isaac; Isaac to Jacob; Jacob to Judah and his brothers.

3–5. From Judah came the line through Tamar, Rahab, and Ruth — showing that God’s promise weaves even through unexpected vessels.
	6.	Jesse fathered Love, David the king; from him came Solomon, born of the woman who had been Uriah’s.

7–11. From Solomon the line continued, through kings and through exile, as faith and love endured even in captivity.

12–16. After the exile, the line continued until Joseph — Increase — the one betrothed to Mary, from whom was born Jesus, the Christ.
	17.	Thus the story unfolds in three sets of fourteen generations: from Faith to Love, from Love to exile, and from exile to the Christ.
	18.	The birth of Jesus the Christ happened this way: Mary, pledged to Joseph, was found with child through the Holy Spirit before they came together.
	19.	Joseph, Increase, being just and unwilling to disgrace her, resolved to act quietly.
	20.	But in a dream, an angel said: “Joseph, son of Love, do not fear to take Mary. What is conceived in her is of the Spirit.”
	21.	“She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”
	22.	All this fulfilled what the prophet had spoken:
	23.	“Behold, the virgin will conceive and bear a son, and they will call his name Emmanuel” — God with us.
	24.	When Joseph awoke, he did as commanded and took Mary as his wife.
	25.	And she bore a son, and he called his name Jesus.
