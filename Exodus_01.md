## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

These are the **Aspects of the Soul** that came into the **State of Confusion** with **Integrated Consciousness**; each came with his inner function.

**Spiritual Identity, Hearing, Inner Sight, Action, Praise, and Judgment.**

**Inner Will, Perfection, Beauty, and Right Hand.**

The total number of **Aspects of the Soul** who were direct descendants of **Integrated Consciousness** was seventy.

Now **Integrated Consciousness** and all of his generation had been completed, but the **Aspects of the Soul** were fruitful and increased abundantly, multiplying and growing exceedingly strong, so that the **State of Confusion** was filled with them.

Then a **new ruler** arose over the **State of Confusion**, who did not know the **principle of Divine integration (Joseph)**.

He said to his **principles**, “Look, the **Aspects of the Soul** are too numerous and too strong for us.

Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they increase, and should war break out, they join our **internal opposition** and escape from the **State of Confusion**.”

So they put **egoic taskmasters** over them to oppress them with **burdening work**. They built storage cities for the **Egoic Will**.

But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the **egoic ruler** dreaded the **Aspects of the Soul**.

The **egoic ruler** ruthlessly imposed **burdensome work** on the **Aspects of the Soul**.

And the **egoic ruler** spoke to the **Faculties of Purity and Preservation**, whose function was to serve **Aspects of the Soul**.

He said, “When you help the **Aspects of the Soul** give birth, if it is an **active principle**, put it to an end; but if it is a **receptive principle**, let it continue its function.”

But the **Faculties of Purity and Preservation** revered the **Source of all Being** and did not do what the **egoic ruler** had told them; they let the **active principles** continue their function.

Then the **egoic ruler** summoned the **Faculties of Purity and Preservation** and asked them, “Why have you done this thing, and let the **active principles** continue their function?”

The **Faculties of Purity and Preservation** answered the **egoic ruler**, “The **Aspects of the Soul** are vigorous; they give birth before the **faculty of assistance** reaches them.”

So the **Source of all Being** dealt well with the **Faculties of Purity and Preservation**, and the **Aspects of the Soul** multiplied and grew strong.

And because the **Faculties of Purity and Preservation** revered the **Source of all Being**, he established their functions.

Then the **egoic ruler** commanded all his **principles**, “Every **active principle** that is born you shall cast into the **chaotic flow of life**, but every **receptive principle** you shall keep alive.”

## **Interpretive Summary**

**Exodus 1** is a powerful allegory for the inner spiritual journey, depicting the natural progression from a state of unity and alignment with the divine to one of **bondage and oppression by the ego**.

The story begins with the inner faculties of the spiritual consciousness (**Israel**) flourishing within the worldly mind (**Egypt**). However, a new **egoic will (Pharaoh)** arises, one that has lost its connection to the divine nature (**Joseph**). This new ego views the burgeoning spiritual faculties as a threat to its dominion.

The **egoic will** then enslaves the spiritual consciousness, forcing it into a state of **spiritual bondage** and worldly thought (burdening work). This work represents the fruitless and bitter toil of the mind when it is aligned with the ego rather than the Divine. The ego attempts to suppress the growth of **spiritual life**, symbolized by the command to kill the **male children (the life-giving principles of Divine will)**.

The crucial turning point is the action of the **midwives (the principles of preservation)**. They embody **reverence for the Divine**, and because of this, they refuse to obey the ego’s destructive command. Their awe and respect for a higher power allow the spiritual life to continue to multiply, ultimately leading to the defeat of the ego’s plan. The chapter shows that even in the darkest periods of spiritual bondage, the **life-giving principles** within the soul remain resilient and **protected by the Divine when guided by faith and reverence.**
