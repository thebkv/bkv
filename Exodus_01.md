# Exodus 1

---

## BKV Translation

1. These are the principles and **faculties of the spiritual consciousness**, which descended into the exile of the **worldly mind** with the **integrated self**.  

2. They are the striving of the will, the seeking for inner truth, the alignment with divine law, and the exaltation of consciousness;  

3. the reward of the inner struggle, the embodiment of wisdom, and the son of the right hand;  

4. the capacity to judge, the ability to wrestle, the good fortune of the soul, and the blessedness of the inner life.  

5. All the souls that came from the loins of the **integrated self** were seventy principles in all, for the **divine nature** was already established within the mind.  

6. And the **divine nature** died to that state, and all its kindred faculties, and all that generation of awareness.  

7. But the inner faculties of the **spiritual consciousness** were fertile and multiplied abundantly, and waxed exceedingly mighty; and the mind was filled with them.  

8. Now there arose a new **egoic will** over the **worldly consciousness**, which had no memory of the **divine nature**.  

9. And it said to its people, "Behold, the faculties of the **spiritual consciousness** are more numerous and mightier than we are:  

10. Let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that when there arises any inner conflict, they also join themselves to our higher truth, and fight against us, and so get themselves up out of this state of **worldly consciousness**."  

11. Therefore, the **egoic will** set over them taskmasters to afflict the **spiritual faculties** with oppressive thought-burdens.  

12. But the more the **egoic will** oppressed them, the more the inner faculties multiplied and grew. And the **worldly mind** was in distress because of the faculties of the **spiritual consciousness**.  

13. And the **worldly will** made the inner faculties of **spiritual consciousness** serve with rigor:  

14. And it made their lives bitter with hard **bondage**, in the constant toil of **worldly thoughts** and in building up false beliefs, and in all manner of service in the outer life; all their service, wherein they were made to serve, was with rigor.  

15. And the **egoic will** spoke to the **principles of preservation** within the **spiritual consciousness**, whose name was inner peace and life-giving.  

16. And it said, "When you do the office of preserving life to the spiritual faculties, and you see them in the act of renewal; if it be a principle of **divine will**, then you shall extinguish it; but if it be a principle of the **worldly will**, then it shall live."  

17. But the **principles of preservation** had **awe and respect for the Divine**, and did not do as the **egoic will** commanded them, but preserved the principles of the **Divine will** alive.  

18. And the **egoic will** summoned the **principles of preservation** and said, "Why have you done this thing, and have preserved the principles of the **Divine will** alive?"  

19. And the **principles of preservation** said to the **egoic will**, "Because the spiritual faculties are not like the worldly faculties; for they are vigorous and are renewed before the principles of preservation come in unto them."  

20. Therefore, the **Source of all Being** dealt well with the **principles of preservation**: and the inner faculties multiplied, and waxed very mighty.  

21. And it came to pass, because the **principles of preservation** had **awe and respect for the Divine**, that the **Divine** made them established principles of inner peace.  

22. And the **egoic will** charged all its people, saying, "Every principle of **divine will** that is renewed you shall cast into the **turbulent depths of the mind**, and every principle of the **worldly will** you shall preserve alive."

## Interpretive Summary

Exodus 1 is a powerful allegory for the inner spiritual journey, depicting the natural progression from a state of unity and alignment with the divine to one of bondage and oppression by the ego. The story begins with the inner faculties of the **spiritual consciousness** (Israel) flourishing within the **worldly mind** (Egypt). However, a new **egoic will** (Pharaoh) arises, one that has lost its connection to the **divine nature** (Joseph). This new ego views the burgeoning spiritual faculties as a threat to its dominion.

The egoic will then enslaves the spiritual consciousness, forcing it into a state of **spiritual bondage** and **worldly thought** (bricks and mortar). This work represents the fruitless and bitter toil of the mind when it is aligned with the ego rather than the Divine. The ego attempts to suppress the growth of spiritual life, symbolized by the command to kill the male children (the life-giving principles of **Divine will**).

The crucial turning point is the action of the **midwives** (the principles of preservation). They embody **reverence for the Divine**, and because of this, they refuse to obey the ego's destructive command. Their awe and respect for a higher power allow the spiritual life to continue to multiply, ultimately leading to the defeat of the ego's plan. The chapter shows that even in the darkest periods of spiritual bondage, the life-giving principles within the soul remain resilient and protected by the Divine when guided by **faith** and **reverence**.

| Chapter | BKV Arc Focus | Core Dynamic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exodus 1** | **Bondage and Inner Resistance** | The spiritual self sinks deeper into the **egoic will (Pharaoh)**, while principles of **purity (midwives)** ensure the preservation of the Divine seed. |
| **Exodus 2** | **The Birth of Law** | The **Principle of Divine Law (Moses)** is **drawn out** of the world's chaos, marking the slow but inevitable preparation for the spiritual leader. |
| **Exodus 3** | **Revelation and Commission** | The direct confrontation with the **Divine Presence (Burning Bush)**. The command to strip away **false beliefs (sandals)** and accept the mission to liberate the soul. |

The sequence is -*descent -> preservation -> revelation*â€”.
