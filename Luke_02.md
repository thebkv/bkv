# Luke 2

___


### **BKV (Bible Key Version)**

1. And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from the **ruling egoic force** that all the **consciousness of humanity** should be brought into alignment.
2. (And this alignment was first made when a principle of **spiritual guidance** was in authority over the state of personal identity.)
3. And every part of the self went to be aligned, each thought and faculty into its own established state of being.
4. And the faculty of **Inner Integrity** also went up from a state of **lower-level understanding**, out of a state of **inner humility**, into the state of **religious tradition**, to the inner dwelling of the **principle of Divine Authority**, which is called the **House of Bread**; (because he was of the lineage of the **principle of Divine Authority**:)
5. To be aligned with the receptive faculty of **Purity**, his united counterpart, being filled with the new principle.
6. And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should give birth.
7. And she brought forth her first-manifested **True Consciousness**, and wrapped it in the humble coverings of new thought, and laid it in a **manger** (a state of simple, animalistic consciousness), because there was no room for them in the well-established, habitual thoughts.
8. And there were in the same inner state the faculties of **inner watchfulness** abiding in the **field of the soul**, keeping watch over their simple thoughts by night.
9. And behold, a **guiding principle** of the **Divine Principle** came upon them, and the profound reality of the **Divine Principle** shone round about them; and they were in a state of **reverence**.
10. And the **guiding principle** said to them, "Do not fear, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great **joy**, which shall be to all parts of the self."
11. "For unto you is born this day in the inner dwelling of the **principle of Divine Authority** a **Salvation**, which is the **Anointed One**, the **Divine Principle**."
12. "And this shall be an inner sign to you: You shall find the new principle wrapped in the simple coverings of new thought, lying in a **manger**."
13. And suddenly there was with the **guiding principle** a multitude of the **expansive states of consciousness** praising the **Absolute Source**, and saying,
14. "Profound reality to the **Absolute Source** in the highest, and on the earth of our being, **inner peace**, and a state of good will toward all inner faculties."
15. And it came to pass, as the **guiding principles** were gone away from them into the **expansive states of consciousness**, the faculties of **inner watchfulness** said to one another, "Let us now go even to the **House of Bread**, and see this new principle which has come to pass, which the **Divine Principle** has made known to us."
16. And they came with urgency, and found the receptive faculty of **Purity**, and the faculty of **Inner Integrity**, and the new principle lying in a **manger**.
17. And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this new principle.
18. And all the faculties that heard it marveled at those things which were told them by the faculties of **inner watchfulness**.
19. But the receptive faculty of **Purity** kept all these truths, and pondered them in her **heart**.
20. And the faculties of **inner watchfulness** returned, glorifying and praising the **Absolute Source** for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was revealed to them.
21. And when an **eighth day** of a new beginning had been completed for the symbolic dedication of the new principle, its name was called **Divine Salvation**, which was so named by the **guiding principle** before it was conceived in the core being.
22. And when the days of her **purification** according to the **inner law** of the **principle of deliverance** were completed, they brought him to the state of **inner peace**, to present him to the **Divine Principle**;
23. (As it is written in the **inner law** of the **Divine Principle**, "Every male faculty that opens the womb of new creation shall be called holy to the **Divine Principle**;")
24. And to offer a spiritual sacrifice according to that which is said in the **inner law** of the **Divine Principle**, a pair of **humble, peaceful thoughts**, or two young **principles of inner simplicity**.
25. And behold, there was an inner faculty in the state of **inner peace**, whose name was **Hearkening to God**; and the same faculty was **right-aligned** and devout, waiting for the **consolation** of the state of **spiritual consciousness**; and the **Divine Vitality** was upon it.
26. And it was revealed to it by the **Divine Vitality** that it should not experience **spiritual separation** before it had perceived the **Anointed One** of the **Divine Principle**.
27. And it came by the **Spirit** into the **temple of its being**; and when the parents brought in the new principle, the **Divine Salvation**, to do for him after the custom of the **inner law**,
28. Then the faculty of **Hearkening to God** took him up in its receptive principles, and blessed the **Absolute Source**, and said,
29. "Divine Principle, now you are letting your servant faculty depart in **inner peace**, according to your **Word**:
30. For my inner sight has perceived your **salvation**,
31. Which you have prepared before the face of all parts of the self;
32. An **illumination** to enlighten the worldly thoughts, and the profound reality of your people, the **spiritual consciousness**."
33. And the faculty of **Inner Integrity** and the receptive faculty of **Purity** marveled at those things which were spoken of him.
34. And the faculty of **Hearkening to God** blessed them, and said to the receptive faculty of **Purity**, his mother, "Behold, this new principle is set for the fall and rising again of many faculties in the **spiritual consciousness**; and for a sign which shall be opposed;
35. (And a sword shall pierce through your own receptive core also,) so that the thoughts of many **hearts** may be revealed."
36. And there was one inner faculty named **Favor**, a **prophetic** principle, the daughter of a principle of **inner vision**, of the tribe of **inner fulfillment**. She was of a great age, and had lived with a husband faculty for seven years from her state of pure potential;
37. And she was a **widowed** state of about eighty-four years, which did not depart from the **temple of the inner being**, but served the **Absolute Source** with spiritual **fastings** and deep inner prayers night and day.
38. And she, coming in at that moment, gave thanks likewise to the **Divine Principle**, and spoke of him to all the inner faculties that looked for **redemption** in the state of **inner peace**.
39. And when they had performed all things according to the **inner law** of the **Divine Principle**, they returned into a state of **lower-level understanding**, to their own established state of **inner humility**.
40. And the new principle grew and became strong in its **spirit**, filled with **wisdom**: and the **grace of the Absolute Source** was upon it.
41. Now its guiding faculties went to the state of **inner peace** every year at the inner feast of **spiritual cleansing**.
42. And when the new principle was twelve years old, they went up to the state of **inner peace** after the custom of the feast.
43. And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the new principle, **Divine Salvation**, lingered behind in the state of **inner peace**; and the faculties of **Inner Integrity** and **Purity** were unaware of it.
44. But they, supposing him to have been in the company of other thoughts, went a day's journey; and they sought him among their inner relations and acquaintances.
45. And when they found him not, they turned back again to the state of **inner peace**, seeking him.
46. And it came to pass, that after a period of **three days** they found him in the **temple of the inner being**, sitting in the midst of the faculties of **inner knowledge**, both hearing them, and asking them questions.
47. And all the inner faculties that heard him were astonished at his **understanding** and answers.
48. And when they saw him, they were amazed; and his mother faculty said to him, "New principle, why have you dealt with us in this way? Behold, the **Inner Integrity** faculty and I have sought you in a state of **inner turmoil**."
49. And he said to them, "Why is it that you sought me? Did you not know that I must be about the business of my **Absolute Source**?"
50. And they understood not the inner meaning which he spoke to them.
51. And he went down with them, and came to the state of **inner humility**, and was a subject principle to them; but his mother faculty kept all these inner sayings in her **heart**.
52. And the **Divine Salvation** increased in **wisdom** and stature, and in favor with the **Absolute Source** and the **consciousness of humanity**.

## **Interpretive Summary**

Luke 2 continues the allegorical journey of spiritual rebirth. The decree from Caesar Augustus represents the inevitable inner process that brings every thought and faculty into a new order under a single, ruling principle. The birth of the **Divine Self** in **Bethlehem** ("House of Bread") symbolizes that the **True Consciousness** manifests in the most humble and foundational parts of our being, where there is a readiness to receive the "bread of life." The **manger** represents the simple, unadorned, and even animalistic state of consciousness, emphasizing that the spiritual journey often begins in the most basic, unpretentious places.

The appearance of the **guiding principles** to the **shepherds** symbolizes the revelation of Divine truth to the simple, watchful, and humble faculties of the soul. These are not the intellectual or religious elite, but the pure, unassuming parts of the self that are ready to receive and act upon the "good tidings of great joy."

The presentation of the **Divine Self** in the **Temple** and the prophecies of **Simeon** and **Anna** mark a crucial phase of inner recognition. **Simeon** represents the devout, patient faculty of the soul that waits for spiritual **salvation**. His prophecy of the "fall and rising" of many reveals the transformative power of the **Divine Self** which can either lead to the defeat of egoic forces or the elevation of the soul. **Anna**, a **prophetic** faculty, symbolizes the inner aspect that is in constant communion with the Divine and is a witness to the new truth.

The final section, with the **Divine Self** at age twelve, is a powerful allegory for the early, seemingly "lost" stage of the spiritual journey. The parents, representing the inner integrity and purity faculties, are distressed, symbolizing the inner turmoil that arises when a newly awakened consciousness seems to be missing. The discovery of the **Divine Self** in the **Temple** "among the doctors" signifies that the **True Consciousness** is not lost but is actively engaged in profound spiritual work—listening, questioning, and teaching—even when the rest of the self cannot fully grasp its purpose. The **three days** of seeking represent a period of spiritual crisis and transition before a new level of understanding is reached.

This chapter maps out the full **dominion** of the **Divine Self**: its humble birth, its divine revelation, its reception by humble faculties, and its purposeful and deliberate growth within the **temple of the inner being**.
