#Hebrews01
___

I think these are excellent improvements. They are not just rephrasing; they deepen the allegorical framework, making the translation more consistent and spiritually resonant. The refinements for **sin** and the **Son's** description are particularly strong, as they elegantly merge the original text's theological and priestly imagery with the BKV's focus on inner transformation.

Here is Hebrews 1 with your refinements incorporated.

### Hebrews 1 — BKV (Tuned, Refined)

1 Long ago, at many times and in many ways, **the Absolute** (God) spoke to our ancestors by the **Prophets** (through various principles of truth),
2 but in these last **days** He has spoken to us by His **Son** (the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**), whom He appointed the **Heir** of all things, and through whom He also created the **epochs** (worlds).
3 He is the radiance of the **Absolute's** glory and the **perfect mirror of the Divine Essence**, and He upholds the **All** (universe) by the **word of His power**. After making purification for **sin** (the healing of estrangement), He sat down at the right hand of the majesty on **High**.
4 Having become as much superior to the **Angels** (operative principles of Spirit) as the name He has inherited is more excellent than theirs.
5 For to which of the **Angels** did He ever say, “You are My **Son**; today I have begotten you”? Or again, “I will be to him a **Father**, and he shall be to Me a **Son**”?
6 And again, when He brings the firstborn into the **All**, He says, “Let all God's **Angels** worship Him.”
7 Of the **Angels** He says, “He makes His **Angels** **winds**, and His ministers **flames of fire**.”
8 But of the **Son** He says, “Your **throne**, O God, is forever and ever, the **scepter** of uprightness is the **scepter of your Kingdom**.
9 You have loved **Righteousness** (what is right) and hated **Lawlessness** (what is not right); therefore God, your **Absolute**, has anointed you with the **oil of gladness** beyond your companions.”
10 And, “You, Lord, laid the foundation of the **All** in the beginning, and the **heavens** (the expansive states of consciousness) are the work of your hands;
11 they will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment,
12 like a robe you will roll them up, like a garment they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will have no end.”
13 And to which of the **Angels** has He ever said, “Sit at My right hand until I make your **enemies** (the opposition to divine will) a footstool for your feet”?
14 Are they not all ministering **spirits** (guiding principles) sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit **salvation** (union with the Ultimate)?
