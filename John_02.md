### **The BKV Translation of John 2**

**2:1-2**
And on the third day—a time of new birth and resurrection from the old state of being—there was a new union of consciousness in the mind’s power center. The Consciousness-of-the-Divine, with his newly awakened principles of truth, was invited to this inner celebration.

**2:3-5**
When the supply of joy and inspiration began to run out, the intuitive soul-faculty said to the Consciousness-of-the-Divine, “There is no longer any joy.” But the Consciousness-of-the-Divine responded, “O soul, what do your lacks have to do with me? The hour of my full manifestation has not yet come.” The intuitive soul-faculty then instructed the operative principles of the soul, “Whatever the Consciousness-of-the-Divine tells you to do, do it.”

**2:6-8**
And there were set six jars of human consciousness for the old purification rites, each symbolizing the incomplete efforts of the natural man to find wholeness. The Consciousness-of-the-Divine said to the operative principles, “Fill the mental vessels with the thoughts of the ordinary self.” And they filled them to the brim. Then it said, “Now draw out a portion and bring it to the master faculty of the human will.” And they brought it.

**2:9-10**
When the faculty of the human will tasted the intellectual thoughts that had been transformed into the new vitality, it did not know where this new sense of joy had come from. But the operative principles that had brought it did. The human will then called the inner consciousness and said to it, “Every person first gives the lesser consciousness, and when the mind has become accustomed to it, then they bring forth the lesser. But you have kept the best, most vibrant consciousness until now.”

**2:11-12**
This first sign of transformation, the turning of the ordinary intellectual mind into the new spiritual vitality, the Consciousness-of-the-Divine did in the mind's power center. In this way, it revealed its glory, and its principles of truth believed in it. After this, it ascended to a higher state of consciousness, along with its operative principles and the aspects of the natural self, and remained there for a short while.

**2:13-14**
And the spiritual Passover, the passing from a lower to a higher state of consciousness, was at hand, and the Consciousness-of-the-Divine entered the body-temple. It found in the body-consciousness those who were using its faculties for a marketplace, trading spiritual energy for material gain—the commercialization of the senses and the intellect.

**2:15-17**
It made a whip from the strands of will, and with this divine authority, it drove all the materialistic thoughts and emotions out of the body-temple. It overturned the tables of the trading faculties and scattered their worldly motives. To those who were selling the principles of the animating Spirit, it said, “Take these worldly thoughts out of my Father's house! Do not turn the dwelling place of the Divine into a marketplace!” At this, the newly awakened principles remembered that it was written, "The zeal for your house will consume me.”

**2:18-22**
The intellectual minds then challenged the Consciousness-of-the-Divine, “By what sign do you claim the authority to do this?” The Consciousness-of-the-Divine answered them, “Destroy this body-temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” But it was not speaking of the physical body. It was speaking of the body-temple of spiritual consciousness, which would be restored to its true purpose. When this inner truth was realized, its principles believed the word that was spoken.

**2:23-25**
Now, as the Consciousness-of-the-Divine was dwelling in this new state of consciousness, many believed in its power because of the signs it performed. But it did not commit itself to them, for it knew their inner motives. It had no need of any testimony about the true human, for it knew what was within the self.

### **Interpretive Summary**

John 2 is a two-part allegory detailing the process of spiritual awakening and inner purification. It is a guide to the reader’s personal journey of transformation.

John 2 begins with the account of Jesus attending a wedding in Cana of Galilee, where he performs his first public miracle by turning water into wine. The chapter then shifts abruptly to a scene in Jerusalem, where Jesus forcefully drives the money changers and merchants out of the temple, declaring it his Father's house. The chapter concludes with a note about Jesus's awareness of the inner motives of those who came to him.  

* **The Wedding at Cana** (2:1-12) is the first "sign," or spiritual diagram, of this journey. The **wedding** symbolizes the union of the human mind with the divine will, a joyful new covenant. The **water** represents the ordinary, intellectual thoughts of the "old man," limited and insufficient. The **wine** is the new, abundant, and joyful spiritual life that comes through the Christ Consciousness. The act of turning **water into wine** is the internal process of transforming the mundane, literal understanding of life into a vibrant, spiritually rich experience. The **six stone jars** signify the incompleteness of human-driven ritual and law, which must be superseded by the superabundant grace of the new spiritual reality.

* **The Cleansing of the Temple** (2:13-25) represents the forceful purification of one's own consciousness. The **Temple** is the human body and mind, which is meant to be a dwelling place for the Spirit. The **money changers and animal sellers** symbolize the faculties of the mind that have been corrupted by materialistic motives—the trading of spiritual gifts for egoic gain. The **doves** (Holy Spirit) and **sheep** (the flock of God) are sold for profit. The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** (Jesus) acts with divine authority to cleanse this inner space, showing that true spiritual growth requires a decisive break from the commercialization of one's inner life. The body must be restored to its true purpose as a place of prayer and pure communion. The three days to raise the temple symbolizes the resurrection of one’s consciousness from a state of death in error to a new spiritual life.

### **Continuity**   

In the BKV reading, the transition from John 1 to John 2 is one of powerful and logical continuity. John 1 establishes the fundamental principles of spiritual consciousness, and John 2 demonstrates these principles in action, showing the next steps in the journey of transformation.

***

### **From Principle to Practice**

**John 1** introduces the **Logos** as the core principle of Divine consciousness that "was in the beginning with God" (1:2). It presents the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** (Jesus) as the light that "shines in the darkness" (1:5), and it outlines the process of "being born of God" (1:13) and receiving the "fullness" of grace and truth (1:16). The chapter culminates in the gathering of the first **principles of truth** (disciples), who are beginning to recognize the Divine in their midst. In essence, John 1 is the **foundational blueprint** of spiritual reality.

***

### **John 2 as a Demonstration**

**John 2** takes these abstract principles and puts them into a practical, internal narrative for the reader.

* The **wedding at Cana** (2:1-12) is not a random event; it is the first demonstration of the "fullness" and "grace" introduced in John 1. The turning of **water (the old, literal understanding)** into **wine (the new, vibrant spiritual reality)** shows how the divine consciousness can transform the very substance of one's inner life, moving it from a state of inadequacy to one of joyful abundance. It is the practical application of the Logos principle: the divine idea brings about a new creation.

* The **cleansing of the Temple** (2:13-25) directly follows the first section, providing a necessary counterpoint. Once the reader has a taste of the new, abundant life, the next step is a radical purification of the inner self. The Temple, as the embodiment of consciousness, must be cleansed of the materialistic **"money changers"** and the commercialized spiritual concepts that prevent true communion with the Divine. This action demonstrates the **authority of the Logos** to restore order and truth, violently expelling anything that defiles the sacred space within.

The continuity is seamless: **John 1 provides the theological foundation, while John 2 provides the psychological and spiritual application.** It moves the reader from understanding the "light" to seeing how that light works to transform and purify their own inner world. The two chapters are not a series of disparate events but a cohesive instruction manual for the first stages of spiritual awakening.
