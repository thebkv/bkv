# Leviticus 7 BKV

### **BKV (Bible Key Version)**

### **Leviticus 7**

1. Likewise, this is the inner law of the **healing of specific separation**: it is a most holy principle.
2. In the place where the surrender of a thought for inner **purification** is made, there also shall the thought for **healing of specific separation** be yielded. And the life-essence of that thought shall be sprinkled all around the altar of inner surrender.
3. And the one who offers shall surrender all of the most abundant part of it: its most potent essence, and the spiritual energy that covers its inner motivations,
4. And the two inner faculties of discernment, and the energy that is on them, which is by the side of the inner self, and the most vital part that is above the center of emotional being, with the faculties of discernment, it shall be taken away:
5. And the inner faculty of mediation shall offer these upon the altar as a surrender made by the inner fire of the **Divine Principle**: it is a **healing of specific separation**.
6. Every male principle among the inner faculties of mediation shall assimilate it. It shall be internalized in a state of inner holiness, for it is a most holy principle.
7. Just as the law of **healing for unconscious separation** is, so is the law for the **healing of specific separation**: there is one rule for both. The inner faculty of mediation that performs the **reconciliation** shall have it.
8. And the inner faculty of mediation that offers any part of consciousness for a complete surrender, that very faculty shall assimilate the outer form of the thought which it has surrendered.
9. And all the sustenance of a daily thought that is fully realized in the mind, and all that is developed in the heat of inner trials, shall belong to the inner faculty of mediation that offers it.
10. And every daily thought-sustenance, mingled with the **overflow of divine favor**, and that which is plain, shall all the spiritual strengths within a new state of consciousness have, each according to its need.
11. And this is the inner law of the surrendered **inner peace**, which a part of the self shall offer to the **Divine Principle**.
12. If a thought-form is offered in a state of **gratitude**, then the offering of gratitude shall be accompanied by a state of pure thoughts mixed with the **overflow of divine favor**, and pure, thin thoughts anointed with the **overflow of divine favor**, and pure thoughts mixed with the **overflow of divine favor**, prepared with fervor.
13. In addition to these pure thoughts, a state of gratitude shall offer its offering with thoughts of daily experience in the surrendered **inner peace**.
14. And from this whole collective thought, a part shall be offered as a lifting up to the **Divine Principle**, and it shall belong to the inner faculty of mediation that sprinkles the **life-essence** of the **inner peace** offering.
15. And the embodied form of the surrendered **inner peace** for gratitude shall be assimilated the very same day that it is offered. No part of it shall remain until the morning of the next inner cycle.
16. But if the offering of a surrendered thought is a promise, or a voluntary act of surrender, it shall be assimilated the same day that the sacrifice is offered. And on the next inner cycle, the remainder of it may also be assimilated.
17. But the remaining embodied form of the surrendered thought on the **third day** shall be utterly consumed by the inner fire of testing.
18. And if any of the embodied form of the surrendered thought of inner peace is assimilated at all on the **third day**, it shall not be received, nor shall it be credited to the one who offers it. It shall be an unacceptable thing, and the soul that assimilates it shall bear its own inner consequence.
19. And the embodied form of the thought that touches anything in a state of **unclean separation** shall not be assimilated; it shall be utterly consumed by the inner fire of testing. And as for the embodied form, all that is in a state of **inner purity** may assimilate it.
20. But the soul that assimilates the embodied form of the surrendered **inner peace** that belongs to the **Divine Principle**, having a state of inner **unclean separation** upon it, that soul shall be cut off from its own spiritual consciousness.
21. Moreover, the soul that touches anything in a state of **unclean separation**, such as the **unclean separation** of a lower aspect of the self, or any impure spiritual faculty, or any unacceptable state of inner **unclean separation**, and then assimilates the embodied form of the surrendered **inner peace** that belongs to the **Divine Principle**, that soul shall be cut off from its own spiritual consciousness.
22. And the **Divine Principle** spoke to the **Principle of Deliverance**, saying,
23. "Speak to the children of **spiritual consciousness**, saying, 'You shall not assimilate the spiritual essence of a thought from an act of power, or of a thought of pure being, or of a thought of inner struggle.'"
24. "And the spiritual essence of a thought that dies of itself, and the essence of that which is torn with inner resistances, may be used for any other purpose, but you shall in no way assimilate it."
25. "For whoever assimilates the spiritual essence of a thought from which a person offers an offering made by the inner fire to the **Divine Principle**, that soul that assimilates it shall be cut off from its own spiritual consciousness."
26. "Moreover, you shall not assimilate the **life-essence** of any kind, whether it be of a thought of the **expansive consciousness** or of a thought of the earthly nature, in any of your dwellings."
27. "Whatever soul it be that assimilates the **life-essence** of any kind, that soul shall be cut off from its own spiritual consciousness."
28. And the **Divine Principle** spoke to the **Principle of Deliverance**, saying,
29. "Speak to the children of **spiritual consciousness**, saying, 'He that offers the surrender of his **inner peace** to the **Divine Principle** shall bring his offering to the **Divine Principle** out of the surrender of his **inner peace**.'"
30. "His own inner actions shall bring the offerings of the **Divine Principle** made by inner fire, the spiritual essence with the innermost intention, and it shall be the innermost intention that he shall bring, so that it may be lifted up as a special offering before the **Divine Principle**."
31. "And the inner faculty of mediation shall burn the spiritual essence upon the altar, but the innermost intention shall belong to the spiritual strength within the new state of consciousness and its related principles."
32. "And the **right-aligned** act of inner service you shall give to the inner faculty of mediation as a lifted offering out of the surrenders of your **inner peace**."
33. "He among the spiritual strengths within a new state of consciousness, who offers the **life-essence** of the **inner peace** offerings, and the spiritual essence, shall have the **right-aligned** act of inner service as his part."
34. "For the lifted offering of innermost intention and the lifted offering of a **right-aligned** act of service have I taken from the children of **spiritual consciousness** from the surrenders of their **inner peace**, and have given them to the inner faculty of mediation and its related principles by a law forever from among the children of **spiritual consciousness**."
35. "This is the portion of the anointing of the inner faculty of mediation and of the anointing of its related principles, out of the offerings of the **Divine Principle** made by inner fire, in the day when he was presented to serve the **Divine Principle** in the office of inner mediation;"
36. "Which the **Divine Principle** commanded to be given them from the children of **spiritual consciousness**, in the day that it anointed them, by a law forever throughout their inner generations."
37. This is the inner law of the complete surrender, of the daily thought-sustenance, and of the **healing of unconscious separation**, and of the **healing of specific separation**, and of the inner setting apart, and of the surrender of **inner peace**;
38. Which the **Divine Principle** commanded the **Principle of Deliverance** on the **high state of inner unity**, in the day when it commanded the children of **spiritual consciousness** to offer their surrenders to the **Divine Principle**, in the **wilderness of inner change**.

### **Interpretive Summary**

Leviticus 7, in the BKV framework, is an intricate manual for the inner workings of spiritual **purification** and surrender. The chapter distinguishes between various types of "offerings," each representing a specific inner process. The **Trespass Offering** (**healing of specific separation**) focuses on the conscious healing of a known inner wrongdoing, while the **Sin Offering** (**healing of unconscious separation**) addresses general or unrecognized flaws. Both require the surrender of the best parts—the "fat" and "blood"—which symbolize the core essence and **life-principle** of the thought-form being surrendered.

The **Peace Offering** is a core teaching, representing the state of **inner peace** and communion with the Divine. The instructions for this offering reveal a three-fold process of spiritual assimilation. A "thank offering" must be consumed on the same day, signifying that gratitude is a state to be lived in the immediate present. A "vow" or "voluntary offering" can be assimilated over two days, representing a sustained spiritual practice. The third day is forbidden for assimilation, as any clinging to a past spiritual state beyond its natural cycle makes the spiritual truth "unclean" and unproductive. This teaches that true spiritual life is not static; it is a dynamic process that must be constantly renewed in the present moment, or it becomes stale and a source of inner **separation**.

The chapter also emphasizes the sanctity of the "fat" and "blood," which must not be "eaten" (assimilated) by the individual. The **fat** represents the spiritual abundance and essence that belongs solely to the **Absolute Source**, while the **blood** represents the **life-principle** that is also solely of the Divine. To "eat" these would be an egoic attempt to claim what belongs to God, resulting in being "cut off from his people," or **separation** from the spiritual community of consciousness. The chapter concludes by reinforcing the roles of the inner faculties (**priests**) who facilitate this intricate process of surrender and **purification**, serving as a permanent guide for a consciousness seeking **union** with the Divine in the **wilderness of inner change**.
