# **Deuteronomy 6:4–9 — BKV Study (The Shema: The Code of Internalization)**
### *Singular Cause, Total Devotion: Embedding the Law into Consciousness*

---

> _“Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:”_ — Deuteronomy 6:4 KJV
> _“And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.”_ — Mark 12:30 KJV

*The Divine Unity must be **heard** not merely in the ear, but in the deepest seat of **awareness**. This declaration, spoken on the **Threshold of Realization**, is the absolute centering point of the soul, transforming belief into **being**. It is the command to make the Source the **singular, non-negotiable reality** of the inner life.*

## **BKV-NR Context — The Law of Internalization**

The **Shema** (Hebrew for "Hear" or "Listen-and-Obey"), delivered at the **Plains of Moab (The Threshold of Realization)**, is the ultimate statement of the **Singularity of Cause** and the command for **Total Internalization**. It shifts the Decalogue (Exodus 20) from an external decree to an **imprinted essence**. This passage defines the human response required by the Divine Law: **Unmixed Love** and the continuous, intentional **embedding of truth** into every aspect of consciousness.

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**  

### **The Law of Singular Cause**

4. **Hear** (receive and integrate), O **Aspects of Consciousness (Israel)**: The **Source**, our Ultimate Reality, is **One Singular Cause**.
5. And thou shalt **love** the **Source**, your Ultimate Reality, with **all your Will (heart)**, and with **all your Sentience (soul)**, and with **all your Force (might)**.

### **The Law of Internalization and Continuity**

6. And these **Words (Principles)**, which I command you this day, shall be **imprinted** upon your **Will (heart)**.
7. And thou shalt **constantly teach** them unto your **subordinate faculties (children)**, and shall **speak** of them when you **dwell** in your **inner house**, and when you are **moving** in your **conscious activity**, and when you are in the **process of rest** (lying down), and when you are **rising** in the **morning of awareness**.
8. And thou shalt **bind** them for a **symbol** upon your **active faculty (hand)**, and they shall be as **frontlets** (a constant reminder) between your **perceptions (eyes)**.
9. And thou shalt **inscribe** them upon the **gates** (points of entry) and the **boundaries** (outer edges) of your **Domain (house)**.

## **Commentary on the Action**

### **1 · The Unmixed Declaration (v. 4)**
The core declaration establishes the **Vertical Axis** of law: **Divine Unity**. The BKV axiom, "The only true cause is the Source," is here stated as the absolute truth of reality. **Shema (Hear)** means more than auditory perception; it is the total act of **receiving and integrating** this singular reality into the will.

### **2 · Total Integration of Faculties (v. 5)**
Love, as commanded, is not an emotion but an **act of unified will**. It demands **Total Devotion** across the three primary faculties:
* **Heart:** The seat of **Will and Intention**.
* **Soul:** The **Sentience and Essence** of the being.
* **Might:** The **Force and Energy** applied in manifestation.
No part of the inner self is permitted mixed allegiance to a "Principle of Cause" outside the Source.

### **3 · The Principle of Continuous Imprinting (v. 6–7)**
The Law must be moved from an external text to an **imprinted essence** within the Will (heart). This imprinted law must then be maintained through **continuous spiritual articulation** (speaking/teaching) across all states of consciousness: **Rest, Activity, Dwelling, and Rising**. Spiritual awareness must be constant, not episodic.

### **4 · Sanctification of Action and Perception (v. 8–9)**
The commands to bind the Law symbolize the **sanctification of every interface** between the soul and the world:
* **Hand:** Sanctification of **Action** (The Law governs all movement and work).
* **Eyes:** Sanctification of **Perception** (The Law filters all incoming thought and sensory data).
* **Gates/Boundaries:** Sanctification of the **Inner Domain** (The Law controls what enters and exits the mind).
