# Luke 5

---

1. One day as the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** was standing by the depths of the **mind**, the numerous **thoughts** were crowding around him and listening to the **word of God**.
2. He saw at the mind’s edge two **vessels for consciousness**, left there by the fleeting **thoughts**, who were cleansing their methods.
3. He got into one of the **vessels**, the one belonging to the **faculty of hearing**, and asked him to put out a little from the shoreline of the **worldly mind**. Then he sat down and imparted **wisdom** to the **thoughts** from the **vessel**.
4. When he had finished speaking, he said to the **faculty of hearing**, “Launch out into the deep of the **unconscious mind**, and let down the methods for a catch.”
5. The **faculty of hearing** answered, “**Master**, our **human will** has worked hard all night and haven’t gained anything. But because you say so, I will let down the methods.”
6. When they had done so, they caught such a large number of **spiritual truths** that their methods began to break.
7. So they signaled their partners in the other **vessel** to come and help them, and they came and filled both **vessels** so full that they began to sink.
8. When the **faculty of hearing** saw this, he fell at the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine's** feet and said, “Go away from me, **Ultimate Reality**; I am a **spiritually estranged** faculty!”
9. For he and all his companion faculties were astonished at the catch of **spiritual truths** they had taken,
10. and so were the **strong will** and **divine grace**, the sons of the **rich reward**, the **faculty of hearing's** partners. Then the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** said to the **faculty of hearing**, “Don’t be afraid; from now on you will gain an abundance of **human consciousnesses**.”
11. So they pulled their **vessels** up on the shoreline of the **worldly mind**, left every **fixed belief** and followed him.
12. While the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** was in one of the states of **receptivity**, a part of the consciousness came along who was covered with **spiritual corruption**. When it saw the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**, it fell with its face to the ground and begged him, “**Ultimate Reality**, if you are willing, you can make me clean.”
13. The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** reached out his hand and touched it. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!” And immediately the **spiritual corruption** left him.
14. Then the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** ordered him, “Don’t tell anyone, but go, show your purified self to the **established belief** and offer the **acts of surrender** that the **Divine plan** commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.”
15. Yet the news about him spread all the more, so that numerous **thoughts** came to hear him and to be healed of their **spiritual sicknesses**.
16. But the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** often withdrew to **solitary places of reflection** and communed with the **Source**.
17. One day, while he was imparting **wisdom**, the **established religious intellect** and the **rigid, intellectual beliefs** were sitting there. They had come from every village of the **receptive state** and from the **religious tradition** and the **established doctrines**. And the **power of the Source** was with him to heal the **spiritually unwell**.
18. Some parts of the **human will** came carrying a spiritually **immobile** faculty on its **lower nature** and tried to take it into the consciousness to lay it before the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**.
19. When they could not find a way to do this because of the numerous **thoughts**, they went up on the roof of the mind and lowered it on its **lower nature** through the **fixed beliefs** into the middle of the numerous **thoughts**, right in front of the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**.
20. When the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** saw their **trusting-belief**, he said, “Friend, your **estrangement from the Divine** is forgiven.”
21. The **established religious intellect** and the **rigid, intellectual beliefs** began thinking to themselves, “Who is this fellow who speaks **blasphemy**? Who can forgive **estrangement from the Divine** but **God** alone?”
22. The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** knew what they were thinking and asked, “Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?
23. Which is easier: to say, ‘Your **estrangement from the Divine** is forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Take mastery over your **lower nature** and begin to act’?”
24. But I want you to know that the **true human** has **spiritual authority** to forgive **estrangement from the Divine** on the lower plane of being.” So he said to the spiritually **immobile** faculty, “I tell you, begin to act, take up your **lower nature** and go within.”
25. Immediately it stood up in front of them, took what it had been confined to and went into its own being praising the **Ultimate Reality**.
26. Every faculty was amazed and glorified the **Ultimate Reality** and were filled with awe. They said, “We have seen remarkable things today.”
27. After this, the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** went out and saw a grasping, **worldly faculty** by the name of **inner will** sitting at his **worldly** post. “Follow me,” the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** said,
28. and the **inner will** got up, left every **fixed belief** and followed him.
29. Then the **inner will** held a great celebration for the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** at its home, and a large number of **worldly** and other **faculties** were celebrating with them.
30. But the **established religious intellect** and the **rigid, intellectual beliefs** who belonged to their sect complained to his **principles**, “Why do you eat and drink with **worldly** and **spiritually estranged faculties**?”
31. The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** answered them, “It is not the **spiritually healthy** who need a **healer**, but the **spiritually unwell**.
32. I have not come to call the **self-righteous**, but the **spiritually estranged** to **inner purification**.”
33. They said to him, “John’s disciples often fast and say prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours go on eating and drinking.”
34. The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** answered, “Can you make the friends of the **Divine union** fast while it is with them?
35. But the time will come when the **Divine union** will be taken from them; in those days they will engage in acts of **self-abnegation**.”
36. He told them this analogy: “No one tears a piece from a **new truth** to patch an **old belief**. Otherwise, they will have torn the **new truth**, and the patch from the **new** will not match the **old**.
37. And no one pours **new, expansive truth** into **old, rigid states of consciousness**. Otherwise, the **new truth** will burst the **old states**; the **truth** will be spilled and the **old states** will be ruined.
38. No, **new truth** must be poured into **new states of consciousness**.
39. And no one after having become accustomed to an **old belief** wants a **new truth**, for they say, ‘The **old** is better.’”

## **Interpretive Summary**

Luke 5 is a deeply symbolic chapter that outlines three key stages in the spiritual journey of the awakening individual. It is a powerful narrative about surrendering the old self and embracing a new consciousness.

The chapter begins with the Miraculous Catch. The **Lake of Gennesaret** represents the depths of the unconscious mind, and the crowd represents the myriad of fleeting thoughts that occupy the surface. The Consciousness-of-the-Divine teaches from a vessel, a symbol of a separate, focused part of the mind. The instruction to "launch out into the deep" is a directive to move beyond superficial intellectualism and into the unconscious depths to find true spiritual insight. The "great haul of fish" that breaks the nets and nearly sinks the boats symbolizes an overwhelming influx of spiritual truths that cannot be contained by the old, limited methods of the human will. Peter's reaction—"Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man"—is the moment of profound spiritual humility and a realization of the great chasm between the lower self and the Divine. The call to "catch men" is a call to use these newly learned methods to help others awaken.

Next, the chapter presents the power of the Consciousness-of-the-Divine to heal the fragmented and the powerless. The man with leprosy represents a part of the mind suffering from spiritual corruption, thoughts and beliefs that are separated and fragmented. The paralytic represents a state of spiritual powerlessness, a faculty that is unable to act on its beliefs. The forgiveness of sins, which the BKV defines as the healing of estrangement from the Divine, is the true act of healing that restores both wholeness and power. The command to "take up your mat" is a powerful symbol of taking mastery over the lower nature to which the spirit has been confined.

The chapter concludes with the call of Levi and the **analogy of the new wine**. Levi, a tax collector, represents the grasping, worldly part of the will. His immediate and total surrender illustrates that true spiritual transformation requires a complete and radical turning away from the old beliefs. The parables of the new wine and the new cloth serve as a profound warning: a new, expansive truth cannot be contained within the old, rigid states of consciousness. If one tries to force it, the old beliefs will be destroyed, and the new truth will be lost.
