#Matthew04

## Chapter 4 Key Notes
- **Wilderness** — Symbol of testing and reliance on God (*Deuteronomy 8:2, Matthew 4:1*).  
- **Forty Days** — Period of completeness in trial or preparation (Moses in Exodus 34:28, Israel in Numbers 14:33-34).  
- **Satan (Adversary)** — Literally “accuser, opponent.” Represents the force of opposition or temptation.  
- **Stones / Bread** — Stones = dead, lifeless forms; Bread = true nourishment from God (*Deuteronomy 8:3*).  
- **Temple (Sanctuary)** — Symbol of the inner place of worship and trust in God.  
- **High Mountain** — Elevated state of vision or perspective, here misused for pride and false dominion.  
- **Galilee (Circle, Rolling)** — Region of transition, often symbol of movement and openness.  
- **Sea** — The restless, unstable mind (*Isaiah 57:20*).  
- **Fishermen** — Those who draw others out of the sea of confusion.  
- **Light** — Revelation, the breaking of divine truth (*Isaiah 9:2, Matthew 4:16*).
- **Wilderness** — Not just empty desert. In Scripture it is the **place of testing, stripping away, and reliance on God** (*Deuteronomy 8:2, Hosea 2:14, Mark 1:12–13*).

## Matthew 4 (BKV Symbolic-Only Restatement)

1. Then **Yahweh Saves** was led by the Spirit into _the_ **Wilderness** to be tested by _the_ **Adversary**.  

2. After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.  

3. And _the_ **Adversary** came and said, “If you are the Son of God, command these **Stones** to become **Bread**.”  

4. But he answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live by **Bread** alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.’”  

5. Then _the_ **Adversary** took him into _the_ **Sanctuary**, and set him on the pinnacle.  

6. He said, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written: ‘He will command his angels concerning you,’ and, ‘On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”  

7. **Yahweh Saves** said, “It is written again: ‘You shall not test the Lord your God.’”  

8. Again, _the_ **Adversary** took him to a very **High Mountain**, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.  

9. He said, “All these I will give you, if you fall down and worship me.”  

10. Then **Yahweh Saves** said, “Away with you, **Adversary**! For it is written: ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.’”  

11. Then the **Adversary** left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.  

12. Now when **Yahweh Saves** heard that **Yahweh is Gracious** had been delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee.  

13. Leaving **City of Peace**, he went and lived in Capernaum by _the_ **Sea**, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,  

14. so that what was spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled:  

15. “The land of Zebulun and Naphtali, by the way of _the_ **Sea**, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations,  

16. the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great **Light**, and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, on them a **Light** has dawned.”  

17. From that time **Yahweh Saves** began to proclaim, saying, “Repent, for _the_ **Reign of Heaven** has drawn near.”  

18. Walking by _the_ **Sea**, he saw two brothers: Simon, called **Rock**, and Andrew, casting a net into _the_ **Sea**, for they were **Fishers of Men**.  

19. And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you **Fishers of Men**.”  

20. Immediately they left their nets and followed him.  

21. Going on, he saw two other brothers, James and John, with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.  

22. Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.  

23. And **Yahweh Saves** went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the good news of _the_ **Reign**, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.  

24. So his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought to him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, the demon-oppressed, epileptics, paralytics, and he healed them.  

25. And great crowds followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, **City of Peace**, Judea, and from beyond the **Descent**.
