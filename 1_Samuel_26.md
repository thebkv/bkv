# 1 Samuel 26 — The Principle of Discernment  
### *The Maturity of Love and the Sleep of the Will*

> _“The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD’s anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.”_  
> — **1 Samuel 26 : 11 KJV**

## **BKV-NR — Narrative Reading**

### **I. The Second Pursuit (vv 1–5)**  

The **Ziphites (Double-Minded Thoughts)** returned and said to Saul,  
> “David hides in the hill of Hachilah.”  

So Saul arose with three thousand chosen men to seek David.  
David sent spies and saw Saul encamped,  
and he came to the place where Saul slept,  
with his spear stuck in the ground at his head  
and **Abner (Light of the Father)** guarding him.

*Again the double mind betrays love,  
but love no longer fears—only watches in discernment.*

---

### **II. The Sleep of the Will (vv 6–12)**  

David said to **Abishai (Gift of the Father)**,  
> “Who will go down with me to Saul?”  

Abishai said, “I will go.”  
They came by night; Saul lay sleeping,  
his spear and water by his head.  

Abishai whispered,  
> “God hath delivered thine enemy into thy hand; let me smite him.”  

David replied,  
> “Destroy him not; for who can stretch forth his hand against the anointed and be guiltless?”  

So David took the **spear** and the **cruse of water**,  
and departed, and no man saw it,  
for a deep sleep from the Source had fallen upon them.

*The soul perceives that vengeance is unnecessary;  
the will lies powerless when Spirit withdraws its motion.*

---

### **III. The Appeal from the Hill (vv 13–20)**  

David went to the opposite hill and cried to Abner, saying,  
> “Art not thou a valiant man? Why hast thou not kept watch over thy lord the king?”  

He held up the spear and cruse of water, saying,  
> “Where is the king’s spear, and the cruse of water that was by his head?”  

Then he called to Saul:  
> “Why doth my lord pursue his servant?  
> For what have I done?”  

Saul recognized David’s voice and wept.

*Discernment exposes error without attack;  
truth awakens the sleeping conscience.*

---

### **IV. The Confession of the Will (vv 21–25)**  

Saul said,  
> “I have sinned; return, my son David, for I will no more do thee harm.”  

David answered,  
> “Behold the king’s spear; let one of the young men come and fetch it.  
> The Source render to every man his righteousness and faithfulness.”  

Then Saul said,  
> “Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things and prevail.”  

So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.

*When love discerns without condemnation,  
even the outer will must acknowledge its rightful king.*

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Samuel 26** reveals the **Law of Discernment** —  
the stage beyond mercy, where love governs through clear vision rather than emotion.

- **Saul** symbolizes the outer will now in spiritual sleep.  
- **David** represents the heart in mastery, acting by divine perception alone.  
- **The Spear** is active power restrained.  
- **The Cruse of Water** is the stream of life withdrawn from the lower nature.  
- **Abishai** is impulsive zeal, loyal but unillumined.  

Love now rules through **discernment, not reaction** — the sign of full inner sovereignty.

## **Addendum — The Law of Discernment**

The soul must not act even in righteousness without divine direction.  
Discernment sees that vengeance is illusion, for the will sleeps by divine decree.  
When the Source withdraws energy from error, it falls of itself.  
The wise heart merely removes the symbols of power and departs in peace.

## **Core BKV Principle — 1 Samuel 26**

> **When love acts by discernment, not desire,  
> the will falls into harmless sleep, and power becomes peace.** 🕊️

### *The Sleep of the Will and the Clarity of Love*

---

26 : 1–5  
Again, the double mind spoke,  
“See, your enemy hides there.”  
But I no longer trembled;  
I watched from afar and waited.  
The will slept beneath its own weight,  
its spear fixed in the earth beside it.  
I stood on the ridge of silence,  
and discerned what once I feared.

---

26 : 6–12  
Zeal whispered, “Strike now.”  
But discernment replied, “No.  
Touch not the anointed,  
for power not guided by truth destroys its own crown.”  
I took the spear and the vessel of life,  
and left the will sleeping.  
No noise, no struggle—only the sound of still air,  
for a deep sleep from the Source had fallen upon them.

---

26 : 13–20  
From the opposite hill I called,  
“Why have you not watched?”  
The echo came back hollow.  
So I held up the symbols—spear and water—  
and spoke not to accuse, but to awaken.  
Even error stirs when truth calls its name.

---

26 : 21–25  
Then the will wept and said, “You are more righteous than I.”  
I answered, “Let each be rendered according to faithfulness.”  
And I walked away beneath the dawn,  
carrying peace instead of victory.

---

### **Meditative Reflection**

> To discern is greater than to conquer.  
> When love sees clearly, wrath dissolves.  
> Power restrained becomes light,  
> and the sleeping will dreams no more of war.
