# Hebrews 2 — BKV Study (The Danger of Neglect and the Pioneer of Salvation)

**Hebrews 2** allows us to understand the foundational reasons for the superiority of the Christ Principle and the urgency of the warning presented in Chapters 3 and 4.

> "Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip." (KJV)

## BKV-NR (Natural Reading)

1. Therefore we ought to give the more **Earnest Heed** to the **Spiritual Utterances** which we have heard, lest at any time we should **Drift Away (Let them slip)**.
2. For if the **Divine Revelation via Intermediate Principles (Word spoken by angels)** was steadfast, and every **Spiritual Transgression** received a just **Consequence**;
3. How shall we escape, if we **Neglect** so great a **Realized State of Spiritual Liberation (Salvation)**; which at the first began to be spoken by the **Christ Principle (Lord)**...

### The Humiliation and Exaltation of the Christ Principle

5. For unto the **New State of Realized Consciousness (World to Come)** has **He** not put in subjection the **Principles of Higher Intellectual Authority (Angels)**.
8. You have put all things in subjection under his **Inner Feet**. For in that **He** put all in subjection under him, **He** left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.
9. But we see **Jesus**, who was made a little lower than the **Principles of Higher Intellectual Authority**, for the **Necessary Spiritual Humiliation (Suffering of death)**, crowned with **Glory and Honor**; that **He** by the **Divine Will** should taste **Spiritual Destruction** for every **Aspect of the Soul**.
10. For it became **Him**, for whom are all **Principles**, and by whom are all **Principles**, in bringing many **Aspects of the Soul (Sons)** unto **Inner Glory**, to make the **Pioneering Principle (Captain)** of their **Realized State of Spiritual Liberation** perfect through **Inner Suffering**.

### The Christ Principle’s Kinship

11. For both **He** that **Consecrates** and they who are **Consecrated** are all of one **Source**: for which cause **He** is not ashamed to call them **Aspects of the Soul (Brethren)**.
14. Forasmuch then as the **Aspects of the Soul** are partakers of **Human Limitation (Flesh and Blood)**, **He** also himself likewise took part of the same; that through **Spiritual Humiliation** **He** might destroy **The Lower Self (him that had the power of death)**, that is, the **Principle of Opposition (the devil)**;
15. And deliver them who through **Fear of Spiritual Destruction** were all their lifetime subject to **Psychological Constraint (Bondage)**.
17. Wherefore in all things it behoved **Him** to be made like unto **His Aspects of the Soul**, that **He** might be a **Merciful and Faithful Principle of Mediation** in things pertaining to the **Divine Source**, to make **Spiritual Reconciliation** for the **Spiritual Transgressions** of the **Aspects of the Soul**.
18. For in that **He** himself has **Suffered** being **Tested**, **He** is able to **Succour** them that are **Tested**.

## Commentary on the Action

Hebrews 2 begins with a stark **Warning Against Spiritual Neglect**, stating that passively drifting away from the **Realized State of Spiritual Liberation** is as fatal as active transgression. The core of the chapter explains why the **Christ Principle** had to accept **Spiritual Humiliation (Suffering of Death)**: to establish Himself as the **Pioneering Principle (Captain)** who could lead many parts of the soul to **Inner Glory**. By fully engaging with **Human Limitation (Flesh and Blood)**, the Christ Principle gained the power to destroy the final hold of the **Principle of Opposition (the Devil)**—the **Fear of Spiritual Destruction**, which is the ultimate **Psychological Constraint** of the unredeemed soul.

## Interpretive Insights

**I.1. The Danger of Drifting (v. 1, 3):** The BKV emphasizes that the greatest danger to the spiritual life is **Passive Neglect**, not necessarily dramatic failure. To **"let them slip" (Drift Away)** means a slow, unconscious regression from the **Earnest Heed** required to maintain the **Spiritual Utterances**. The more profound the **Salvation** (the message of Christ), the more severe the consequence of mere inattention.

**I.2. The Purpose of Humiliation (v. 9-10, 14):** The **Christ Principle** voluntarily accepting the **Suffering of Death** (spiritual humiliation) was not a random act, but a **necessary strategic move**. By taking on **Human Limitation (Flesh and Blood)**, the Principle of Divine Self **consecrates** the way and becomes the **Captain/Pioneer**—the one who has gone first, perfecting the path through the very experience of suffering. This act specifically targets and destroys the **Principle of Opposition**'s ultimate weapon: the **Fear of Spiritual Destruction**, thereby freeing the soul from its chief **Psychological Constraint**.

**I.3. The Christ Principle as Mediator (v. 17-18):** The final verses assure the soul that the Christ Principle's experience of **Testing** was complete. This experience makes **Him** a **Merciful and Faithful Principle of Mediation**—a faculty that fully understands and is capable of helping every tested aspect of the soul. This ensures that every inner principle has a **Mediator** that can effectively make **Spiritual Reconciliation** for its **Transgressions**.
