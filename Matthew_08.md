#Matthew08

## Chapter 8 Key Notes
- **Separated One (Leper)** — One cut off, excluded; symbol of sin or separation (*Leviticus 13–14*).  
- **Outsider of Authority (Centurion)** — Gentile commander, foreign to covenant, yet perceives true authority. Symbol of faith beyond boundaries.  
- **The Struggling Ones (Israel)** — From Jacob’s renaming; those wrestling with God (*Genesis 32:28*). Here, insiders by name but lacking living faith.  
- **All Nations (East and West)** — Gathering of people into God’s Reign from beyond Israel (*Isaiah 59:19*).  
- **Separation (Outer Darkness)** — Being cut off from God’s presence, exclusion from light.  
- **Oppressive Forces (Demons)** — Destructive impulses, spiritual bondage.  
- **Unclean Lives (Swine)** — Wasted or destructive existence.  
- **Chaos of the Mind (Sea)** — Symbol of restlessness and instability (*Isaiah 57:20, Daniel 7:2–3, Revelation 21:1*).  
- **Turmoil (Storm)** — Fear, chaos, testing of faith.  
- **Reborn Humanity (Son of Man)** — Jesus’ title for himself: true humanity, humble yet exalted, destined for dominion (*Daniel 7:13–14*).

## Matthew 8 (BKV Symbolic-Only Restatement)

1. When Jesus came down from the **Elevated State of Mind**, great crowds followed him.  

2. A **Separated One** came and knelt before him, saying, “Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.”  

3. Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I will; be clean.” And immediately he was cleansed.  

4. Jesus said, “Tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift Moses commanded, as a testimony.”  

5. When he entered Capernaum, an **Outsider of Authority** came to him, appealing,  

6. “Lord, my servant lies paralyzed at home, suffering terribly.”  

7. Jesus said, “I will come and heal him.”  

8. The **Outsider of Authority** replied, “Lord, I am not worthy to have you under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed.  

9. For I too am under authority, with soldiers beneath me. I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”  

10. When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said, “Truly, with no one among **the Struggling Ones** have I found such faith.  

11. Many will come from the **All Nations** and recline at table with **Faith (Abraham)**, **Laughter (Isaac)**, and **Supplanter (Jacob)** in the **Reign of Heaven**,  

12. while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into **Separation**. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”  

13. And to the **Outsider of Authority** Jesus said, “Go; let it be done for you as you have believed.” And his servant was healed at that very moment.  

14. When Jesus entered Peter’s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.  

15. He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and served him.  

16. That evening they brought to him many oppressed by **Oppressive Forces**, and he cast them out with a word and healed all who were sick.  

17. This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: “He took our illnesses and bore our diseases.”  

18. When Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave orders to go to the other side.  

19. A scribe came and said, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”  

20. Jesus said, “Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but **Reborn Humanity** has nowhere to lay his head.”  

21. Another disciple said, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.”  

22. Jesus said, “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”  

23. When he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.  

24. And behold, a great **Turmoil** arose on the **Chaos of the Mind**, so that the boat was being swamped; but he was asleep.  

25. They went and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing.”  

26. He said, “Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?” Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the **Chaos of the Mind**, and there was a great calm.  

27. They marveled, saying, “What sort of man is this, that even winds and the **Chaos of the Mind** obey him?”  

28. When he came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two men oppressed by **Oppressive Forces** met him, coming out of the tombs, fierce so that no one could pass that way.  

29. They cried out, “What have you to do with us, Son of God? Have you come to torment us before the time?”  

30. A herd of many **Unclean Lives** was feeding at some distance.  

31. The forces begged him, “If you cast us out, send us into the **Unclean Lives**.”  

32. He said, “Go.” So they came out and went into the **Unclean Lives**, and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the **Chaos of the Mind** and drowned.  

33. The herdsmen fled, went into the city, and told everything, especially what had happened to those oppressed by the forces.  

34. And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they begged him to depart from their region.
