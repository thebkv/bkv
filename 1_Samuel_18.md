## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

### **I. The Covenant of Souls (vv 1–4)**  

When David had finished speaking with Saul, the soul of **Jonathan (Gift of the Source)** was knit with the soul of **David (Beloved)**,  
and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.  

Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David,  
and his garments, and even his sword, and his bow, and his girdle.  

*Faith recognizes love as its true successor; the old strength yields its symbols to the new heart.*

---

### **II. The Rise of David (vv 5–7)**  

David went out wherever Saul sent him and behaved wisely.  
The people rejoiced, singing,  
> “Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.”  

*Public acclaim follows inner alignment; yet praise, when misinterpreted, becomes the seed of envy.*

---

### **III. The Birth of Jealousy (vv 8–12)**  

Saul was very wroth, and said,  
> “They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me but thousands. What can he have more but the kingdom?”  

And Saul eyed David from that day forward.  

An evil spirit of restlessness troubled Saul, and as David played the harp, Saul cast a javelin at him.  

*The outer will resents the peace it cannot command.  It turns its weapons against the harmony that exposes its emptiness.*

---

### **IV. The Duplicity of Reward (vv 13–27)**  

Saul made David captain over a thousand, hoping danger would destroy him.  
He offered his daughters as snares of obligation.  
David replied with humility,  
> “Who am I, that I should be son-in-law to the king?”  

Yet when the condition was met, Saul gave **Michal (Stream of Love)** to David,  
and she loved him.  

*Even schemes of envy are turned to blessing when the heart is innocent.*

---

### **V. The Increasing Fear (vv 28–30)**  

When Saul saw and knew that the Source was with David,  
he became David’s enemy continually.  
But David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul,  
and his name was much set by.  

*Outer will grows weaker before the rising heart; fear always yields to love, though not without struggle.*

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Samuel 18** unveils the **Law of Divine Friendship** — the covenant between **Faith (Jonathan)** and **Love (David)**, and the jealousy of the **Outer Will (Saul)** that cannot endure their unity.

- **Jonathan and David** represent spiritual friendship within the self — faith recognizing the ascendancy of love.  
- **Saul’s envy** is the lingering self-will that feels displaced by the peace of surrender.  
- **The Robe, Sword, and Bow** symbolize the transference of authority, action, and intention from the rational mind to the heart.  
- **Michal** represents the soul’s emotional nature beginning to harmonize with divine affection.  
- **The Harp and Javelin** show that the same sound that heals the will also exposes its dissonance.  

When faith and love are joined, inner harmony grows too radiant for the old self to bear.

## **Addendum — The Law of Divine Friendship**

True friendship is the covenant between faith and love —  
faith yields its armament; love receives its loyalty.  
Envy arises whenever the will clings to power it no longer deserves.  
Only when friendship rules within does the kingdom know peace.

## **Core BKV Principle — 1 Samuel 18**

> **Faith crowns love and yields its sword; envy resists and destroys its own peace.  
> The soul ascends when its inner friends covenant together in truth.**
