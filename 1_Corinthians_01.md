# 1 Corinthians 1 — BKV Study (The Principle of Singular Foundation)  
### *Against Fragmentation: The Necessity of a Unified Core Truth*  

---

> _“Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.”_ — 1 Corinthians 1:10 KJV
> _“But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty.”_ — 1 Corinthians 1:27 KJV

*The **Inner Church** (the assembled faculties of consciousness) must be absolutely **unified** around a single, foundational truth. The **Creative Impulse** deliberately selects the **Principle of Weakness** to nullify the self-reliance of the **Higher Faculty (Mind)**, ensuring that all power and glory remain fixed upon the **Singular Foundation**.*

## BKV-NR Context — The Confrontation with Fragmentation  

**1 Corinthians 1** immediately addresses the problem of **Internal Fragmentation** (schisms/divisions) arising from misplaced identity and attachment to secondary principles. Having established the **Law of Divine Resolution** (Romans 8) and **Sovereignty** (Romans 9), Paul now confronts the attempt by various faculties within consciousness to claim alignment based on **human authority** (Paul, Apollos, Cephas) or **intellectual striving** (Greek wisdom). The chapter serves to recenter the entire **Inner Church** (the assembled faculties) on the single, necessary foundation: the **Principle of Divine Humanity** (Christ, symbolized by the **Cross**).

## BKV-NR (Natural Reading)  

### **The Demand for Unity**

10. Now I appeal to you, **Inner Principles (brethren)**, by the name of the **Principle of Divine Humanity (Christ Jesus)**, that you all **speak the same Core Truth** (thing), and that there be **no divisions** (schisms) among you; but that you be perfectly **unified** (joined together) in the **Same Mind** and in the **Same Judgment**.
12. Now this I mean, that every one of you is saying, "I am aligned with **Structure (Paul)**"; or, "I am aligned with **Eloquence (Apollos)**"; or, "I am aligned with **Foundational Authority (Cephas)**"; or, "I am aligned with **Truth Itself (Christ)**."
13. Is the **Principle of Divine Humanity** fragmented?

### **The Principle of Weakness**

23. But we preach the **Principle of Divine Humanity** as the **Sacrificial Act (Crucified)**, which is unto the **Elect Faculties (Jews)** a **Stumbling Block** (Law of Works), and unto the **Intellectual Faculty (Greeks)**, an **Absurdity** (Foolishness).
24. But unto those who are **Called** (The Illumined), both the **Elect** and the **Externalizers (Greeks)**, the **Principle of Divine Humanity** is the **Source's Power** and the **Source's Wisdom**.

### **The Nullification of Self-Power**

27. But the **Source** has chosen the **Principle of Weakness** (foolish things of the world) to **nullify** (confound) the **Principle of Self-Sovereignty** (wise); and the **Source** has chosen the **Unimpressive Things** (weak things of the world) to **nullify** the **Principle of Strength** (mighty).
29. That **no Lower Faculty (flesh)** should **glorify itself** in the presence of the **Source**.
30. But of him are you in **Divine Humanity**, who is made unto us **Wisdom from the Source**, and **Alignment (Righteousness)**, and **Consecration (Sanctification)**, and **Total Freedom (Redemption)**:
31. That, according as it is written, "He that **glorifies**, let him **glorify only in the Source**."

## **Commentary on the Action**

### **1 · Fragmentation as Misplaced Identity (vv 10–13)**
The divisions in consciousness are caused by mistaking **secondary principles** (Paul/Structure, Apollos/Eloquence, Cephas/Authority) for the **Singular Foundation**. **Unity** is mandatory for the **Inner Church** and requires all faculties to operate with the **Same Mind** (unified focus on Source) and **Same Judgment** (unified perception of Core Truth). **Fragmentation** is the consequence of identifying the self-will with an imperfect, temporary manifestation.

### **2 · The Power of the Principle of Weakness (vv 23–24)**
The **Principle of Divine Humanity** established through the **Sacrificial Act (Cross)** is deliberately presented in a form that is useless to the **Law of Works** (stumbling block) and repugnant to the **Intellectual Faculty** (absurdity). This **Principle of Weakness** is the **Source's** master strategy: it cannot be grasped or exploited by self-effort, thus ensuring that those who accept it recognize it as the **Source's Power** and not their own.

### **3 · The Nullification of the Higher Faculty (vv 27–31)**
The Source chooses what the ego views as "weak" and "foolish" to **nullify** (confound) the very **Higher Faculty** that attempts to govern itself (the self-sovereign Mind). This is done expressly so that **no Lower Faculty (flesh)** can **glorify itself**. All **Wisdom, Alignment, and Freedom** must be sourced **from the Source**, ensuring the continuous operation of the **Law of Singular Cause**.

## **Scriptural Cross References**

| Reference | BKV Theme Link | Connection to 1 Corinthians 1 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exodus 20:3** | **Singularity of Cause** | The prohibition of "other gods" is violated by the Corinthian schisms (v. 12). Identifying with human leaders is a form of **Misplaced Causality** that fragments the Inner Church. |
| **Romans 7:18** | **The Lower Faculty** | The **Lower Faculty** has "no operative Divine Good." This is why the Source chooses **weak things** (v. 27)—to prevent the **Lower Faculty** from claiming glory for alignment it cannot execute. |
| **Romans 9:32** | **The Stumbling Block** | The **Sacrificial Act (Cross)** is the ultimate **Stumbling Block** (v. 23). It is the final truth that the **Law of Works** (self-effort) must reject in order to maintain its illusion of self-generated merit. |
| **Jeremiah 9:23–24** | **Glorifying the Source** | The command to glory only in the Source's understanding (not human wisdom/might) is the direct foundation for Paul’s conclusion (v. 31) that all glory must be referred back to the **Singular Cause**. |

## **Core BKV Principle**
> *The integrity of the **Inner Church** depends on absolute **Unity** and **Singular Foundation**. The **Source** deliberately uses the **Principle of Weakness** to **nullify** the **Self-Sovereignty** of the aspiring will, ensuring that no internal **Faculty** may claim credit for the alignment and that all glory is fixed solely upon the **Singular Cause**.*
