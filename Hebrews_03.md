## BKV-NR (Natural Reading)

1. Wherefore, holy **Principles**, partakers of the **Principle of the Higher Calling**, consider the **Christ Principle (Apostle and High Priest)** of our **Core Spiritual Principle (Profession)**.
2. Who was faithful to **Him** that appointed **Him**, as also **The Principle of Divine Law (Moses)** was faithful in all **His Inner House**.
3. For this **Principle** was counted worthy of more **Inner Glory** than **The Principle of Divine Law**, inasmuch as **He** who has built the **Inner House** has more **Honor** than the **Inner House** itself.
6. But the **Christ Principle** as a **Principle of Divine Self (Son)** over **His Own Inner House**; whose **Inner House** are **We**, if we hold fast the **Confidence** and the **Rejoicing** of the **Inner Hope** firm unto the **End**.
7. Wherefore, as the **Divine Energy (Holy Ghost)** says, “**Today** if you will hear **His Inner Voice**,
8. **Harden not your Principles of Consecration (hearts)**, as in the **Inner Provocation**, in the **Day of Spiritual Testing** in the **Wilderness**:
9. When your **Principles of Action (fathers)** tested **Me**, proved **Me**, and saw **My Spiritual Works** forty **Cycles of Testing**.
10. Wherefore **I** was angry with that **Old, Unregenerate Aspect of the Soul**, and said, **They always err in their Principles of Consecration**; and they have not known **My Spiritual Paths**.
11. So **I** swore in **My Wrath**, **They shall not enter into My State of Realized Consciousness (Rest)**.”
12. Take heed, **Principles of the Soul**, lest there be in any of you an **Inner State of Unbelief (Evil Heart of Unbelief)**, in **Departing** from the **Self-Existent Reality**.
13. But **Exhort** one another **Daily**, while it is called **Today**; lest any of you be **Deceived** through the **Subtlety of Spiritual Disorder (Sin)**.
14. For we are made **Partakers** of the **Christ Principle**, if we hold the beginning of our **Confidence** steadfast unto the **End**.
19. So we see that they could not enter in because of **Unbelief**.

## Commentary on the Action

Hebrews 3's primary action is a **Direct Warning** comparing the authority of the **Christ Principle** to the **Principle of Divine Law (Moses)**. The Christ Principle is superior because He is the *builder* of the **Inner House (the Soul)**, whereas Moses was only a faithful *servant* within it.

The entire chapter pivots on a quote from **Psalm 95** (referencing the Kadesh-Barnea failure) to deliver the critical warning: The **Old, Unregenerate Aspect of the Soul** was denied the **State of Realized Consciousness (Rest)** because of the **Hardened Heart**—a stubborn, self-willed **Inner State of Unbelief**. The BKV mandate is to maintain **Confidence** and actively **Exhort** the internal principles **Daily** to prevent the subtle deception of **Spiritual Disorder** from causing a final, tragic **Departing** from the **Self-Existent Reality**.

## Interpretive Insights

**I.1. Christ as Builder vs. Moses as Servant (v. 2-6):** This comparison establishes a hierarchy of **Inner Principles**. The **Principle of Divine Law (Moses)** is essential and faithful, but subordinate to the **Christ Principle**. The Law creates structure, but the Christ Principle provides **Divine Self-Authority** and *builds* the soul into the dwelling place of the Spirit (**His Own Inner House**). The soul must recognize that the Law serves the Christ Principle, not the other way around.

**I.2. The Hardened Heart of Unbelief (v. 8, 12):** The **Hardened Heart** is the essence of the failure in the **Wilderness (Spiritual Testing)**. It is a **Principled Resistance** to the Divine Will, choosing the **Ego's Inner Sight** (fear/sight of giants) over **Divine Command (Unbelief)**. The most dangerous state is the **Inner State of Unbelief (Evil Heart)** which leads to **Departing**—the complete abandonment of the spiritual path.

**I.3. The Power of "Today" and Perseverance (v. 7, 13, 14):** The constant repetition of **"Today"** means the decision to obey and believe is always **Immediate** and **Present**. The warning against **Spiritual Disorder (Sin)** is that it is **Subtle** and uses **Deception** to slowly erode **Confidence**. **Perseverance** is the only antidote. We are only made **Partakers** of the Christ Principle if we hold our initial **Confidence** steadfast to the **End**, resisting the pattern of the **Old Aspect of the Soul**.

## BKV Note on Deuteronomy 1 and Psalm 95

The core of the warning in Hebrews 3 rests entirely on two Old Testament *typoi*:

1.  **Deuteronomy 1 (The Historical Type):** The author of Hebrews uses the **First Generation’s failure at Kadesh-Barnea** as the primary historical type. This event is the definitive example of the **Old, Unregenerate Aspect of the Soul** (those delivered from Egypt) being barred from the **Full State of Spiritual Inheritance (Promised Land)** due to **Unbelief**.
2.  **Psalm 95:7-11 (The Prophetic Type):** The author quotes this Psalm directly. The Psalm's warning about **"hardening your heart as in the provocation"** is the **Principle of Divine Law's** eternal lament over the soul's consistent failure to trust during the **State of Spiritual Testing (Wilderness)**.

By linking them, the text confirms that the **Promised Land** of the Old Covenant is now spiritually realized as **God's Rest** in the New Covenant. The danger remains exactly the same: **Unbelief today leads to exclusion from the Inner Rest, just as it led to exclusion from the Outer Land.**
