# 1 Samuel 14 — The Principle of Divided Impulse

> _“It may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.”_  
> — **1 Samuel 14 : 6 KJV**

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

### **I. The Secret Venture of Faith (vv 1–10)**  

**Jonathan (Gift of the Source)** said to his armor-bearer,  
> “Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these **uncircumcised (unconsecrated forces)**.  
> It may be that the Source will work for us; for there is no restraint to save by many or by few.”  

*Faith always begins with a “perhaps.”  It trusts divine possibility before certainty.*  

Saul tarried in **Gibeah (Hill of the Will)** under a pomegranate tree, surrounded by six hundred men.  
Jonathan and his armor-bearer climbed between **Bozez (Gleaming)** and **Seneh (Thorny)** — the bright and the perilous — to reach the garrison.  

*Every act of faith must pass between light and difficulty.*

Jonathan said,  
> “If they say, ‘Come up to us,’ then we will go up: for the Source hath delivered them into our hand.”  

Faith discerns opportunity even in invitation to risk.

### **II. The First Victory (vv 11–15)**  

The Philistines saw them and said,  
> “Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they hid.”  

Jonathan climbed up on hands and feet, and they fell before him; about twenty men were slain.  
Then **the earth quaked**, and a trembling fell upon the host.  

*True faith shakes the whole field of opposition; the vibration of confidence spreads through fear itself.*

---

### **III. The Confusion of the Camp (vv 16–23)**  

The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah saw the multitude melting away.  
Saul called the people to arms and numbered them.  
While he hesitated, the tumult increased.  

**Jonathan’s faith** had already won what **Saul’s hesitation** could not begin.  

When Saul and the people joined battle, the Philistines turned their swords against one another, and the Source saved Israel that day.  

*Faith had wrought victory; control arrived late to claim it.*

---

### **IV. The Rash Vow (vv 24–35)**  

Saul had adjured the people, saying,  
> “Cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies.”  

The people were faint, yet none ate.  
But Jonathan, who heard not the command, dipped his rod in a honeycomb and tasted it;  
and his eyes were enlightened.  

*The vow of fear starves strength; the taste of truth restores sight.*  

When told of his father’s oath, Jonathan said,  
> “My father hath troubled the land.”  

The people later ate meat with blood, breaking the law in desperation.  
*Excessive restraint breeds rebellion; forced piety ends in transgression.*

---

### **V. The Near Destruction of Jonathan (vv 36–46)**  

Saul sought to continue pursuit but inquired of God and received no answer.  
He said, “Draw ye near, that we may know who hath sinned.”  
The lot fell upon Jonathan, who confessed:  
> “I did but taste a little honey with the end of my rod, and lo, I must die.”  

The people answered,  
> “Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid.”  

They rescued Jonathan, and Saul refrained from further pursuit.  

*The voice of collective reason saves the pure impulse from destruction by the tyrant of control.*

---

### **VI. The Epilogue of Saul’s Rule (vv 47–52)**  

Saul fought on every side and prevailed outwardly,  
yet the chapter ends with a tone of restlessness — battles won but peace not found.  

*External success cannot hide inner disorder; divided impulse reigns.*

---

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Samuel 14** presents the soul’s divided state: the *Gift of the Source* acts in faith, while the *Outer Will* binds itself by fear.

- **Jonathan** symbolizes faith’s spontaneous obedience — trust unafraid of odds.  
- **Saul** symbolizes self-conscious control — the will seeking certainty and appearance of righteousness.  
- **Bozez and Seneh** mark the twin aspects of spiritual endeavor: illumination and hardship.  
- **The Rash Vow** exposes the moral inversion where piety becomes tyranny.  
- **Honey** represents enlightenment and joy — forbidden only to the mind that mistakes control for holiness.  

This chapter reveals that obedience without faith is tyranny, and faith without obedience is recklessness — the balance is divine alignment.

## **Addendum — The Law of Divided Impulse**

Faith and fear cannot reign together.  
When faith acts, fear must fall silent; when fear commands, faith starves.  
Every rash vow is the echo of doubt pretending to be devotion.  
Only trust that listens can sustain divine order.

## **Core BKV Principle — 1 Samuel 14**

> **Faith moves through peril and wins by trust; fear binds itself by rules and loses by zeal.  
> The divided soul must choose between control and confidence in the Source.**
