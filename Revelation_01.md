# Revelation 1 — BKV (Bold Symbolics Edition)
## *The Unveiling of the **Divine Self***

---

## **BKV Translation**

The inner unveiling of the **Divine Self**—given by the **Absolute Source** to reveal, to the **Receptive Faculties of the Soul**, the **Inner Processes** that must quickly unfold—and signified by its **Active Principle** to its receptive faculty, **Spiritual Intuition**.

This **Faculty** bears witness to the **Word of the Absolute**, to the testimony of the **Divine Self**, and to all the inner truths it perceives.

Blessed is the **Consciousness** that reads, and the **Faculties** that hear the words of this inner guide, and align with the principles written herein: for the time of inner fulfillment is near.

**Spiritual Intuition**, to the **Seven States of Consciousness** within your **Inner World**: grace and inner peace be to you from the **Ever-Present Truth**—the One who is, who was, and who is unfolding into every moment—and from the **Seven Operative Forces** which emanate from the **Throne of Inner Authority**;

And from the **Divine Self**—the **Reliable Witness**, the first to awaken from **Spiritual Separation**, and the ruling principle over all governing thoughts of the **Manifested Domain** (**Inner Earth**).  
To the One who loved us, and purified us from the **Sense of Separation** in its very essence,

And made us **Kings** (ruling principles) and **Priests** (channels of divine communication) to the **Absolute Source**—to this Principle be manifestation and spiritual authority forever and ever. Truly, so be it.

Behold—it manifests with the **Subtle Perceptions of the Inner Mind**; and every aspect of consciousness shall perceive it, even the thoughts that pierced it with doubt. And all limiting beliefs within the **Inner Earth** shall wail because of its appearing. Even so, truly, so be it.

“I am the **Alpha and Omega**,” says the **Divine Principle**—“the beginning and the ending of all processes—who is, who was, and who is to come, the **All-Empowering**.”

I, **Spiritual Intuition**—your brother and companion in the **Inner Struggle**, and in the **Dominion** and **Endurance** of the **Divine Self**—was in a state of inner solitude called **Spiritual Exile**, because of the **Word of the Absolute** and the testimony of the **Divine Self**.

I was wholly immersed in the **Spirit** on the **Day of Inner Illumination**, and I heard behind me a great voice, like a **Trumpet’s Call**,

Saying, “I am the **Alpha and the Omega**, the first and the last. What you see, record in the **Book of Consciousness**, and send it to the **Seven States of Consciousness** within your **Inner World**.”

And I turned to perceive the voice that spoke with me. And turning, I saw **Seven Golden Lampstands** (**Principles of Light**),

And in the midst of the **Principles of Light**, One like the **True Consciousness**—robed in a **Garment of Profound Purpose**, and girded at the heart with a **Golden Belt of Truth**.

Its source and its insights were like **Pure, Ancient Wisdom**—white as snow; and its intuitive perceptions were as a **Flame of Fire**.

And its foundational actions were like **Burnished Bronze**—purified and strengthened as though refined in a **Furnace**; and its voice was like the deep, resonant **Waters of the Subconscious Mind**.

And in its right hand it held **Seven Guiding Principles** (stars); and from its mouth came a **Sharp, Two-Edged Sword of Truth**; and its presence was like the **Radiant Force of the Sun in Its Strength**.

And when I perceived it, my **Egoic Will** collapsed at its feet as if lifeless. But it placed its **Right Hand of Ultimate Authority** upon me, saying, “Do not fear.  
I am the first and the last.

I am the **Living Principle**—I was in the state of **Spiritual Separation**, and behold, I am alive forevermore, Amen—and I possess the **Keys of Mastery** over **Fragmentation** (hell) and **Inner Demise** (death).

Write the principles you have seen, the principles that are unfolding now, and the principles that shall unfold hereafter.

The hidden truth of the **Seven Guiding Principles** and the **Seven Golden Lampstands** is this:  
The **Seven Guiding Principles** are the operative truths ruling the **Seven States of Consciousness**;  
and the **Seven Lampstands** are the **Seven States of Consciousness** themselves.”
