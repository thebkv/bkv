# Revelation 1 — BKV (Refined Draft, Bold Symbolics)
## *The Unveiling of the **Divine Self***

---

## **BKV Translation (Bold Symbolics Edition)**

The inner unveiling of the **Divine Self**—given by the **Absolute Source** to reveal, to the receptive faculties of the soul, the inner processes that must quickly unfold—and signified by its **Active Principle** to its receptive faculty, **Spiritual Intuition**.

This faculty bears witness to the **Word of the Absolute**, to the testimony of the **Divine Self**, and to all the inner truths it perceives.

Blessed is the consciousness that reads, and the faculties that hear the words of this inner guide, and align with the principles written herein: for the time of inner fulfillment is near.

**Spiritual Intuition**, to the **Seven States of Consciousness** within your **Inner World**: grace and inner peace be to you from the **Ever-Present Truth**—the One who is, who was, and who is unfolding into every moment—and from the **Seven Operative Forces** which emanate from the **Throne of Inner Authority**;

And from the **Divine Self**—the **Reliable Witness**, the first to awaken from **Spiritual Separation**, and the ruling principle over all governing thoughts of the **Manifested Domain** (**Inner Earth**).  
To the One who loved us, and purified us from the **Sense of Separation** in its very essence,

And made us **Kings** (ruling principles) and **Priests** (channels of divine communication) to the **Absolute Source**—to this Principle be manifestation and spiritual authority forever and ever. Truly, so be it.

Behold—it manifests with the **Subtle Perceptions of the Inner Mind**; and every aspect of consciousness shall perceive it, even the thoughts that pierced it with doubt. And all limiting beliefs within the **Inner Earth** shall wail because of its appearing. Even so, truly, so be it.

“I am the **Alpha and Omega**,” says the **Divine Principle**—“the beginning and the ending of all processes—who is, who was, and who is to come, the **All-Empowering**.”

I, **Spiritual Intuition**—your brother and companion in the **Inner Struggle**, and in the **Dominion** and **Endurance** of the **Divine Self**—was in a state of inner solitude called **Spiritual Exile**, because of the **Word of the Absolute** and the testimony of the **Divine Self**.

I was wholly immersed in the **Spirit** on the **Day of Inner Illumination**, and I heard behind me a great voice, like a **Trumpet’s Call**,

Saying, “I am the **Alpha and the Omega**, the first and the last. What you see, record in the **Book of Consciousness**, and send it to the **Seven States of Consciousness** within your **Inner World**.”

And I turned to perceive the voice that spoke with me. And turning, I saw **Seven Golden Lampstands** (**Principles of Light**),

And in the midst of the **Principles of Light**, One like the **True Consciousness**—robed in a **Garment of Profound Purpose**, and girded at the heart with a **Golden Belt of Truth**.

Its source and its insights were like **Pure, Ancient Wisdom**—white as snow; and its intuitive perceptions were as a **Flame of Fire**.

And its foundational actions were like **Burnished Bronze**—purified and strengthened as though refined in a **Furnace**; and its voice was like the deep, resonant **Waters of the Subconscious Mind**.

And in its right hand it held **Seven Guiding Principles** (stars); and from its mouth came a **Sharp, Two-Edged Sword of Truth**; and its presence was like the **Radiant Force of the Sun in Its Strength**.

And when I perceived it, my **Egoic Will** collapsed at its feet as if lifeless. But it placed its **Right Hand of Ultimate Authority** upon me, saying, “Do not fear.  
I am the first and the last.

I am the **Living Principle**—I was in the state of **Spiritual Separation**, and behold, I am alive forevermore, Amen—and I possess the **Keys of Mastery** over **Fragmentation** (hell) and **Inner Demise** (death).

Write the principles you have seen, the principles that are unfolding now, and the principles that shall unfold hereafter.

The hidden truth of the **Seven Guiding Principles** and the **Seven Golden Lampstands** is this:  
The **Seven Guiding Principles** are the operative truths ruling the **Seven States of Consciousness**;  
and the **Seven Lampstands** are the **Seven States of Consciousness** themselves.”
