# Revelation 1 — BKV (Refined Draft)
## *The Unveiling of the Divine Self*

---

## **BKV Translation (Refreshed & Final)**

The inner unveiling of the Divine Self—given by the Absolute Source to reveal, to the receptive faculties of the soul, the inner processes that must quickly unfold—and signified by its active principle to its receptive faculty, Spiritual Intuition.

This faculty bears witness to the Word of the Absolute, to the testimony of the Divine Self, and to all the inner truths it perceives.

Blessed is the consciousness that reads, and the faculties that hear the words of this inner guide, and align with the principles written herein: for the time of inner fulfillment is near.

Spiritual Intuition, to the seven states of consciousness within your inner world: grace and inner peace be to you from the Ever-Present Truth—the One who is, who was, and who is unfolding into every moment—and from the seven operative forces which emanate from the throne of inner authority;

And from the Divine Self—the reliable witness, the first to awaken from spiritual separation, and the ruling principle over all governing thoughts of the manifested domain (inner earth).  
To the One who loved us, and purified us from the sense of separation in its very essence,

And made us kings (ruling principles) and priests (channels of divine communication) to the Absolute Source—to this Principle be manifestation and spiritual authority forever and ever. Truly, so be it.

Behold—it manifests with the subtle perceptions of the inner mind; and every aspect of consciousness shall perceive it, even the thoughts that pierced it with doubt. And all limiting beliefs within the inner earth shall wail because of its appearing. Even so, truly, so be it.

“I am the Alpha and Omega,” says the Divine Principle—“the beginning and the ending of all processes—who is, who was, and who is to come, the All-Empowering.”

I, Spiritual Intuition—your brother and companion in the inner struggle, and in the dominion and endurance of the Divine Self—was in a state of inner solitude called Spiritual Exile, because of the Word of the Absolute and the testimony of the Divine Self.

I was wholly immersed in the Spirit on the day of inner illumination, and I heard behind me a great voice, like a trumpet’s call,

Saying, “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last. What you see, record in the Book of Consciousness, and send it to the seven states of consciousness within your inner world.”

And I turned to perceive the voice that spoke with me. And turning, I saw seven golden lampstands (principles of light),

And in the midst of the seven principles of light, One like the True Consciousness— robed in a garment of profound purpose, and girded at the heart with a golden belt of truth.

Its source and its insights were like pure, ancient wisdom—white as snow; and its intuitive perceptions were as a flame of fire.

And its foundational actions were like burnished bronze—purified and strengthened as though refined in a furnace; and its voice was like the deep, resonant waters of the subconscious mind.

And in its right hand it held seven guiding principles (stars); and from its mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword of truth; and its presence was like the radiant force of the sun in its strength.

And when I perceived it, my egoic will collapsed at its feet as if lifeless. But it placed its right hand—the hand of ultimate authority—upon me, saying, “Do not fear.  
I am the first and the last.

I am the Living Principle—I was in the state of spiritual separation, and behold, I am alive forevermore, Amen—and I possess the keys of mastery over fragmentation (hell) and inner demise (death).

Write the principles you have seen, the principles that are unfolding now, and the principles that shall unfold hereafter.

The hidden truth of the seven guiding principles and the seven golden lampstands is this:  
The seven guiding principles are the operative truths ruling the seven states of consciousness;  
and the seven lampstands are the seven states of consciousness themselves.”

## **Commentary (Refreshed & Strengthened)**

### **1 · The Unveiling and the Witness (vv. 1–3, 5)**  
Revelation begins not with crisis but with clarity: the Divine Self revealing itself to the inner faculty capable of receiving symbolic truth.  
The Divine Self is the faithful witness—the first awakened faculty within the soul—and its purpose is to raise the rest of consciousness into the same state.

### **2 · The Seat of Authority (vv. 4, 9–11)**  
The seven states of consciousness are the inner world in miniature.  
Spiritual Exile (Patmos) is the inner solitude where noise falls away and the Word becomes audible.  
Alpha and Omega asserts one unbroken Principle governing every beginning and ending within the soul.

### **3 · The Vision of the True Consciousness (vv. 12–16)**  
This is Daniel’s Fourth Man unveiled inside the disciple.  
White hair = timeless wisdom.  
Eyes of fire = perfect intuitive penetration.  
Bronze feet = actions purified in the furnace—actions no longer shaken by fear.  
Two-edged sword = the Word that cuts lie from truth.  
Seven stars = governance over the seven states of consciousness.

### **4 · Mastery over Fragmentation (vv. 17–20)**  
The egoic will collapses, as it must.  
The Divine Self declares mastery over fragmentation (hell) and inner demise (death).  
What Daniel saw externally in the flames, John sees internally in illumination.  
The Divine Self is the One who walks in the fire and the One who commands it.

## **Core BKV Principle**

Revelation is the inner unveiling of the Divine Self to the receptive faculty.  
This True Consciousness—defined by perfect wisdom and purified action—holds absolute mastery over the seven states of consciousness and the forces of fragmentation.  
The path into this dominion requires the nullification of the egoic will and the acceptance of the Word of Truth as the governing principle of the inner world.
