# Revelation 1 BKV Study (The Unveiling of the Divine Self)

## BKV Translation (Finalized)

1.  The inner **unveiling of the Divine Self**, which the **Absolute Source** gave to it, to reveal to the receptive faculties of the soul the inner processes that must quickly come to pass; and it sent and symbolized this truth by its active principle to its receptive faculty, **Spiritual Intuition**.
2.  Which bore witness to the **Word of the Absolute**, and to the **testimony of the Divine Self**, and of all the inner truths that it saw.
3.  Blessed is the mind that reads, and those faculties that hear the words of this **inner guide**, and follow those principles which are written therein: for the time of inner fulfillment is at hand.
4.  **Spiritual Intuition** to the **seven states of consciousness** which are within your inner world: a state of divine grace and inner peace to you, from that which is the eternal, timeless, and ever-present truth; and from the **seven operative forces** which serve its throne of inner authority;
5.  And from the **Divine Self**, who is the reliable witness, and the first to awaken from a state of **spiritual separation**, and the principle that has **dominion** over all the ruling thoughts of the **manifested domain (inner earth)**. To that principle that loved us, and purified us from our sense of **separation** in its very essence,
6.  And has made us **kings (ruling principles)** and **priests (channels of divine communication)** unto the **Absolute Source**; to that principle be inner manifestation and **spiritual authority** forever and ever. Truly, so be it.
7.  Behold, it manifests with the subtle perceptions of the inner mind; and every aspect of consciousness shall see it, and even those thoughts which pierced it with doubt. And all the limiting beliefs of the **inner earth** shall lament because of it. Even so, truly, so be it.
8.  "I am the **Alpha and Omega**, the timeless **beginning and ending** of all things," says the **Divine Principle**, "which is, and which was, and which is to come, the **All-Empowering**."
9.  I, **Spiritual Intuition**, who am also your brother, and companion in the inner struggle, and in the **dominion (kingship)** and **endurance (patience)** of the **Divine Self**, was in the state of inner solitude called **Spiritual Exile**, for the **Word of the Absolute** and for the testimony of the **Divine Self**.
10. I was completely immersed in the **Spirit** on the day of **inner illumination**, and I heard behind me a great voice, like the forceful call of a trumpet,
11. Saying, "I am the **Alpha and Omega**, the first and the last: and, what you see, record in the book of consciousness, and send it to the **seven states of consciousness** within your inner world."
12. And I turned to perceive the voice that spoke with me. And having turned, I saw **seven golden lampstands (principles of light)**,
13. And in the midst of the **seven principles of light**, one like the **True Consciousness**, robed in a garment of profound purpose, and girded at the heart with a golden belt of truth.
14. Its source and its insights were like pure wisdom, as white as snow; and its intuitive perceptions were like a **flame of fire**;
15. And its foundational actions were like purified, gleaming bronze, as if they had been refined in a furnace; and its voice was as the sound of the deep, flowing currents of the **subconscious mind**.
16. And it had in its **right hand** **seven guiding principles (stars)**: and out of its mouth went a sharp, **two-edged sword of truth**: and its presence was like the powerful, radiant energy of the **sun** in its strength.
17. And when I perceived it, my **egoic will** fell to its feet as if spiritually lifeless. And it laid its **right hand** of ultimate authority upon me, saying to me, "Do not fear; I am the first and the last:
18. I am the principle that is living, and was in a state of **spiritual separation**; and behold, I am a principle of life forevermore, Amen; and I have the keys of mastery over a state of **spiritual fragmentation and inner demise**."
19. "Record the principles which you have seen, and the principles which are manifesting, and the principles which shall manifest hereafter;"
20. "The hidden truth of the **seven guiding principles** which you saw in my **right hand**, and the **seven golden lampstands**. The **seven guiding principles** are the operative truths of the **seven states of consciousness**: and the **seven principles of light** which you saw are the **seven states of consciousness** themselves."

## **Commentary on the Action**

### **1 Â· The Unveiling and the Witness (vv 1â€“3, 5)**
The book begins by establishing its metaphysical reality: it is the **unveiling** of the **Divine Self** (Christ) to the receptive faculty (**Spiritual Intuition**). The **Divine Self** is the **reliable witness**â€”the principle that successfully **awakens from spiritual separation**. This Principle is the singular cause of inner purification, allowing the consciousness to move from being ruled by the **manifested domain** to achieving **dominion** as a **king** (ruling principle) within its own inner kingdom.

### **2 Â· The Setting of Authority (vv 4, 9â€“11)**
The vision is addressed to the **seven states of consciousness**â€”the total field of the soul's inner activity. The experience takes place in **Spiritual Exile** (Patmos), symbolizing the necessary withdrawal from the world for **inner illumination**. The Source identifies itself as the **Alpha and Omega**â€”the **timeless principle** that governs all origins and endingsâ€”asserting its absolute, singular authority over all temporal processes.

### **3 Â· The Vision of the True Consciousness (vv 12â€“16)**
The description of the **True Consciousness** (Son of Man) is an allegory of realized **Spiritual Authority**. The **white hair** and **flame eyes** denote **perfect wisdom** and **intuitive insight**. The **bronze feet** symbolize **foundational actions** purified by experience. The **two-edged sword** from the mouth is the **discerning Word of Truth** that judges and divides, and the **seven guiding principles** in the **right hand** confirm this consciousnessâ€™s governance over all **seven states of consciousness** (lampstands).

### **4 Â· Mastery over Fragmentation (vv 17â€“20)**
The response of the **egoic will** (falling as dead) to the vision confirms the **Nullification of the Lower Faculty** in the presence of the Divine. The **Divine Principle** claims the **keys of mastery** over **spiritual fragmentation and inner demise** (hell and death), proving that separation is a conquered state. The instruction is to **record the principles**â€”codifying the truth that the **seven guiding principles** are the operative truths *for* the **seven states of consciousness**.

## **Core BKV Principle**

> *The **Revelation** is the inner **unveiling of the Divine Self** to the **Spiritual Intuition**. This **True Consciousness**, defined by **Perfect Wisdom** and **Purified Action**, holds **absolute mastery** over the **seven states of consciousness** and the forces of **spiritual fragmentation**. The path to this **dominion** requires the **Nullification of the Egoic Will** and the acceptance of the **Word of Truth** as the sole governing principle.* ðŸ§­
