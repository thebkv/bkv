## Commentary on the Action

Psalm 118 is a triumphant declaration of **Inner Salvation** following a profound trial (**Inner State of Difficulty**). The soul affirms that its trust must be placed in the **Self-Existent Reality**, rejecting reliance on the **External Personality** or **Worldly Authority**. The spiritual crisis (being surrounded by **Hardened Principles**) is overcome by the **Authority** of the Divine. The Psalm’s core revelation is the recognition that the **Christ Principle (The Stone)**, which was rejected by the soul's **Ego's Faculties**, is now revealed to be the **Supreme Foundation** upon which all true spiritual life must be built. The entire experience culminates in rejoicing in the **Inner Cycle of Divine Manifestation (The Day the Lord hath made)**.

## Interpretive Insights

**I.1. The Futility of Worldly Reliance (Psalm 118:8-9):** The emphatic repetition serves as a fundamental BKV directive. Putting **Inner Confidence in the External Personality (man)** or **Worldly Authority (princes)** is guaranteed to fail during the **Inner State of Difficulty**. True **Spiritual Enlargement** comes only from calling upon and trusting the **Self-Existent Reality**. This is the necessary shift from self-will to Divine Will.

**I.2. The Rejected Stone and the Supreme Foundation (Psalm 118:22-23):** This is the clearest New Testament prefigurement in the Old Testament, directly allegorical to the crucifixion (Luke 23).
* **The Stone:** The **Christ Principle** or the **Inner Foundation of Truth**.
* **The Builders:** The **Ego's Faculties**—the intellect, conscience, and will of the unregenerate mind (like Pilate and the Pharisees)—who reject the Christ Principle because it does not fit their scheme of self-construction.
* **Head Stone of the Corner:** The stone is subsequently revealed by the **Divine Work** to be the **Supreme Foundation** necessary to unite the two walls of the soul (the natural and the spiritual). This is the key to the rebuilt **Spiritual Structure**.

**I.3. The Gate and the Day of Manifestation (Psalm 118:19-24):** The soul seeks the **Path of Justified Action (Gate of Righteousness)**, recognizing that only the righteous **Aspects of the Soul** may enter. The climax is the experience of the **Inner Cycle of Divine Manifestation (The Day the Lord hath made)**. This is not a 24-hour period, but an **unfolding state of consciousness** where Divine Will is palpably present, compelling the soul to **rejoice** and offer the **Sacrifice** (v. 27).
