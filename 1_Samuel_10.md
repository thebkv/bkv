# **1 Samuel 10 — The Principle of Confirmation**
### *The Trial of Image and the Descent of Temporary Spirit*

> _“And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.”_  
> — **1 Samuel 10 : 6 KJV**

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

### **I. The Private Anointing (vv 1–8)**  

Samuel took a vial of oil, poured it upon Saul’s head, and kissed him, saying,  
> “Is it not because the Source hath anointed thee to be captain over His inheritance?”  

He gave Saul three confirming signs:  
- Two men at **Rachel’s Sepulchre (Memory of Desire)** would tell him the asses were found.  
- Three men at the **Plain of Tabor (Elevation of Vision)** would give him bread.  
- A company of prophets at **Gibeah (Hill of God)** would cause him to prophesy.  

*The anointing comes with confirmation, but each sign warns of its own peril: memory, vision, and inspiration — all can be claimed by the self.*

Samuel said,  
> “Do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.”  

*The Spirit permits the will to act freely under grace, to test its loyalty.*

### **II. The Transformation (vv 9–13)**  

As Saul turned from Samuel, **God gave him another heart**, and all those signs came to pass.  
When he met the prophets, the **Spirit of God** came upon him, and he prophesied among them.  

The people said,  
> “What is this that is come unto the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”  

*Outer inspiration is easily mistaken for inner transformation.  Power descends, but character remains untested.*

When the inspiration ceased, Saul went home, and the matter of kingship he told to no one.  
*The new heart is granted; the old nature waits its hour.*

---

### **III. The Public Selection (vv 17–24)**  

Samuel gathered the tribes to **Mizpeh (Watchtower)** and presented them before the Source.  
The lot fell upon Saul the son of Kish.  
But Saul could not be found; he had hidden himself among the baggage.  

*The self both seeks the crown and hides from it — pride and unworthiness alternating masks of the same ego.*

They brought him forth, and he stood head and shoulders above all the people.  
The people shouted, “God save the king!”  

*The outer stature confirms the image the people desired — leadership visible, impressive, and yet uncertain.*

---

### **IV. The Dismissal (vv 25–27)**  

Samuel wrote the manner of the kingdom in a book and laid it before the Source.  
Saul returned to his house in Gibeah, and valiant men followed him, whose hearts God had touched.  
But certain sons of Belial despised him, saying, “How shall this man save us?” and they brought him no presents.  
He held his peace.  

*Every outer rule begins surrounded by both admiration and doubt — the divided response of consciousness to its own creation.*

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Samuel 10** unveils the **Law of Confirmation** — the descent of Spirit upon the form chosen by human desire.

- **Anointing** marks the divine allowance of the soul’s choice, not its endorsement of perfection.  
- **Signs** represent the stages of apparent validation that precede testing.  
- **Spirit of Prophecy** indicates the temporary empowerment that accompanies new office.  
- **Hiding among the baggage** portrays the inner contradiction of the ego — craving recognition yet fearing exposure.  
- **Public acclaim** signals the crystallization of form — what was inward command now becomes outward system.  

The Spirit descends not to glorify the image but to reveal its limits.

## **Addendum — The Law of Confirmation**

Every new power must be tested.  
Spirit may descend upon the outer self for a season, to show what form without substance becomes.  
True kingship is not bestowed by acclaim but by endurance under inner command.  

The anointing tests before it enthrones.

## **Core BKV Principle — 1 Samuel 10**

> **The Spirit may empower the outer form, but only obedience sustains it.  
> When image receives the crown, it is not yet victory but trial.**
