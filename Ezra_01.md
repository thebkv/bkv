>_“...Whosoever there is among you of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in >Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is in Jerusalem.”_

1.  Now in the first **cycle of experience** of **The External Will**, king of **The World**, that the **Core Truth** of the **Self-Existent Reality** spoken by **The Principle of Divine Purpose** might be accomplished, the **Self-Existent Reality** stirred up the **Inner Intention** of **The External Will**, king of **The World**, that he made a **declaration** throughout all his **kingdom**, and put it also in **writing**, saying,
2.  “Thus says **The External Will**, king of **The World**: The **Self-Existent Reality**, the **Source** of **Heaven and Earth**, has given me all the **kingdoms of consciousness**; and he has **commissioned** me to build him a **spiritual structure** in **The Inner State of Peace**, which is in **The State of Praise**.
3.  Who is there among you of all his **Aspects of the Soul**? His **Source** be with him, and let him go up to **The Inner State of Peace**, which is in **The State of Praise**, and build the **Inner Temple** of the **Self-Existent Reality**, the **Source** of **Spiritual Identity**, (He is the **Source**,) which is in **The Inner State of Peace**.
4.  And whoever remains in any **place of spiritual sojourning** where he dwells, let the **aspects** of his **place** help him with **material sustenance**, and with **inner resources**, and with **spiritual devotion**, besides the **free offering** for the **Inner Temple** of the **Source** that is in **The Inner State of Peace**.”
5.  Then rose up the **chief principles** of the ancestral **faculties**, and of the **Inner Will**, and of the **Divine Intention**, with all those whose **Inner Intention** the **Source** had **stirred up**, to go up to build the **Inner Temple** of the **Self-Existent Reality** which is in **The Inner State of Peace**.
6.  And all those who were about them strengthened their **inner efforts** with **silver resources**, with **inner resources**, with **spiritual devotion**, and with **humble domestic support**, besides all that was willingly **devoted**.
7.  Also **The External Will** the king brought forth the **sacred inner virtues** of the **Inner Temple** of the **Self-Existent Reality**, which **The State of Spiritual Rebellion** had brought forth out of **The Inner State of Peace** and had put in the **temple of the self**.
8.  Even those did **The External Will** king of **The World** bring forth by the **Principle of Sustenance**, the **treasurer**, and numbered them to **Principle of Restoration**, the **ruling aspect** of **The State of Praise**.
9.  And this is the number of them: thirty **virtues of gold**, a thousand **virtues of silver**, nine and twenty **spiritual offerings**,
10. thirty **virtues of gold** of a lesser sort, **silver virtues** of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other **virtues** a thousand.
11. All the **virtues** of **gold** and of **silver** were five thousand and four hundred. All these did **Principle of Restoration** bring up with those of the **Aspects of the Soul** who were brought up from **Bondage** to **The Inner State of Peace**.

### Interpretive Insights

**I.1. Cyrus: The External Will (Ezra 1:1-2):** Cyrus, a non-Israelite king, represents an **External, Worldly Authority** or principle that the Divine uses as an **Unknowing Agent** to initiate the soul's return. The Divine is sovereign and can use any structure, even worldly power, to fulfill the necessary spiritual mandate.

**I.2. The Stirred Intention (Ezra 1:1, 5):** The phrase "stirred up the spirit" is key. The impulse to return to the **Spiritual Foundation (Jerusalem)** does not come from the oppressed **Aspects of the Soul** but from a direct, initial **Divine Impulsion** or activation of the **Inner Intention**. This shows that the rebuilding begins with grace, not solely human effort.

**I.3. The Return of the Sacred Vessels (Ezra 1:7-11):** The **Vessels** (cups, bowls, etc.) symbolize the **Sacred Treasures of the Soul**—the pure principles, disciplines, and virtues (like gratitude, discipline, truthfulness) that were profaned and scattered during the **Bondage (Babylon)**. The return is the act of **reclaiming and rededicating** these inner qualities back to their original purpose in the **Inner Temple**.

## Interpretive Notes

The chapter describes how **The Self-Existent Reality** uses the **External Will (Cyrus)** to issue a decree, simultaneously stirring the **Inner Intention** of the **Aspects of the Soul** to rise from **Bondage** and reclaim their **Sacred Inner Virtues** to rebuild the **Spiritual Foundation (Jerusalem).**

It confirms the principle of **Divine Sovereignty**.

The **Self-Existent Reality** is sovereign over all internal and external principles, meaning it will use **any agent**—even a non-spiritual or worldly authority like **Cyrus (The External Will)**—to initiate, enable, or enforce the necessary spiritual transformation and restoration within the soul.

In other words, the Lord can use anything He needs, regardless of whether it appears to us to be "spiritual" or divine.
