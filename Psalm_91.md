## BKV-NR (Natural Reading)

1 He that dwells in the **Innermost State of Consecration (Secret Place of the Most High)** shall abide under the **Principle of Divine Protection (Shadow of the Almighty)**.
2 I will say of the **Self-Existent Reality**, **He** is my **Inner Refuge** and my **Inner Fortress**: my **Source**; in **Him** will I trust.
3 Surely **He** shall deliver you from the **Subtle Spiritual Attacks (Snare of the Fowler)**, and from the **Diseases of the Soul (Noisome Pestilence)**.
4 **He** shall cover you with **His Principle of Divine Covering (feathers)**, and under **His Nurture (wings)** shall you trust: **His Inner Truth** shall be your **Inner Shield** and **Inner Buckler**.
5 You shall not be afraid for the **Psychological Fears (Terror by night)**; nor for the **Open Attacks of Chaos (Arrow that flieth by day)**;
6 Nor for the **Spiritual Disease** that walks in **Inner Darkness**; nor for the **Inner Destruction** that wastes at **Midday**.
7 A **Thousand Principles of Chaos** shall fall at your side, and **Ten Thousand Principles of Temptation** at your right hand; but it shall not come near your **Core Consciousness**.
9 Because you have made the **Self-Existent Reality**, which is my **Inner Refuge**, even the **Most High**, your **Inner Habitation**;
10 There shall no **Spiritual Disorder** befall you, neither shall any **Inner Suffering** come near your **Inner Dwelling**.
11 For **He** shall give **Higher Guiding Principles (His Angels)** charge over you, to keep you in all your **Spiritual Paths**.
12 They shall bear you up in their **Principles of Action**, lest you dash your **Principle of Identity (foot)** against a **Principle of Stumbling (Stone)**.
13 You shall tread upon **Overt Spiritual Aggression (the Lion)** and **Subtle, Hidden Deceit (the Adder)**: the **Young Lion** and the **Dragon** shall you trample under **Inner Feet**.
14 Because he has **Set his Principle of Total Consecration (Love) upon Me**, therefore will **I** deliver him: **I** will set him on high, because he has known **My Name**.
15 He shall call upon **Me**, and **I** will answer him: **I** will be with him in **Inner Suffering**; **I** will deliver him, and **Honor** him.
16 With **Eternal Inner Life (Long Life)** will **I** satisfy him, and show him **My Inner Salvation**.

## Commentary on the Action

Psalm 91 is a declarative assurance of the **Divine Security** available to the soul, but it is deeply conditional. The condition is established in the first verse: **Dwelling** in the **Innermost State of Consecration**. The soul must consciously reside in this protected place. Once this condition is met, the **Principle of Divine Protection** is guaranteed against every form of attack: **Subtle Spiritual Attacks** (snare), **Diseases of the Soul** (pestilence), **Psychological Fears** (night), and **Open Attacks** (day). The protection is active, utilizing **Higher Guiding Principles (Angels)**, and results in mastery over both **Overt Aggression (Lion)** and **Subtle Deceit (Adder)**. The promise culminates in **Eternal Inner Life** (Long Life).

## Interpretive Insights

**I.1. The Condition of Dwelling (v. 1, 9):** The BKV emphasizes that the entire psalm flows from a single, active choice: **He that dwelleth...** The **Innermost State of Consecration (Secret Place)** is not a physical location but a state of **sustained, conscious adherence** to the Divine Center. The **Principle of Divine Protection** (Shadow) is automatic only for the Principle that has made the Most High its **Inner Habitation**. If the soul wanders back into the **External Consciousness**, the shadow is lost.

**I.2. The Nature of Spiritual Attack (v. 3-6, 13):** The psalm identifies two main forms of **Inner Dangers** that assail the soul:
* **Subtlety and Chaos:** The "snare of the fowler" and "pestilence that walks in darkness" are hidden, insidious forms of temptation or spiritual fatigue that strike the soul when it is unvigilant.
* **Conscious Fear:** The "terror by night" (unconscious dread/anxiety) and the "arrow that flieth by day" (conscious doubt/criticism) target the mind during both unilluminated and illuminated states.
The protection guarantees not that the attacks won't happen, but that they **"shall not come nigh your Core Consciousness"** (v. 7, 10).

**I.3. The Prerequisite of Consecration (v. 14):** The final three verses summarize the Divine covenant by declaring the human prerequisite: **"Because he has Set his Principle of Total Consecration (Love) upon Me."** Protection is not random luck; it is the **Inevitable Consequence** of the soul's commitment. Knowing the **Divine Name** means achieving a realized, experiential understanding of the **Divine Source's Nature** and making that Source the supreme object of its will. The result is the ultimate reward: **Eternal Inner Life** (Long Life).

A Christian must take this Psalm very seriously. It is indeed incredibly beautiful, and it is also extremely important. To Dwell in the Secret Place hinges on **a decision** to practice the presence of God. This idea encapsulates the necessary *spiritual exercise* that makes the security of Psalm 91 a reality. According to the only true authority on the matter, the kingdom brought by the Messiah is not a physical kingdom, but something _within you_. Something you actually experience.

The line **"Practice the Presence of God"** is, in BKV terms, the **Principle of Sustained Consecration in Action.**

Here is the BKV interpretation of that concept:

| Literal Action | BKV Principle in Action | The Inner Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Practice** | **Active, Volitional Effort** | The conscious choice of the will to overcome the natural inertia of the lower mind. |
| **The Presence** | **The Innermost State of Consecration** | The sustained focus on the Divine Center, ensuring the soul "dwells" in the Secret Place. |
| **Of God** | **The Self-Existent Reality** | The recognition that the Source is not remote, but the constant, surrounding reality (The Shadow of the Almighty). |

The act of "Practicing the Presence of God" is the psychological discipline required to turn the one-time **decision** to dwell in the Secret Place into a **sustained state** of abiding.

It is the daily, moment-by-moment spiritual labor that keeps the **Principle of Divine Protection** active, ensuring that the **Principles of Chaos** (the thousands and ten thousands) "shall not come nigh your Core Consciousness."
