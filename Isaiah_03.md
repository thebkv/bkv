# Isaiah 3 — BKV (Traditional Layout)
## *The Collapse of False Supports and the Exposure of the Inner City*

---

## **Summary**
Isaiah 3 reveals what happens inside the soul when it attempts to govern its own “Jerusalem” without the presence and order of God. Every false support collapses. The faculties that once felt strong prove fragile. Desires become vain. Gateways of thought mourn. This is not destruction but purification: everything that falls was never stable to begin with. Isaiah 3 prepares the way for Isaiah 4, where the inner city is restored under God’s own covering.

# **Isaiah 3 — KJV / BKV Comparison Table**

| Verse | KJV Text | BKV (Bible Key Version) |
|-------|----------|-------------------------|
| **1** | “For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,” | When the **Inner City of Peace** (Jerusalem) and the **Praise-Consciousness** (Judah) trust their own devices, the Source withdraws the **false supports** they rely on. Bread and water—spiritual sustenance and clarity—are withheld to reveal how fragile self-made identity truly is. |
| **2–3** | “The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient, the captain of fifty… the honourable man, and the counsellor…” | All the **inner faculties** that once felt strong—strategy, discernment, leadership, foresight—collapse. The entire inner government is revealed as powerless without God. |
| **4** | “And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.” | When divine order fades, the soul is ruled by **immature impulses**—reaction, whim, and untested emotion. |
| **5** | “And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour…” | Inner conflict rises. Thoughts oppose thoughts; desires oppose convictions. Division becomes oppression. |
| **6–7** | A man is urged to be ruler—“Be thou our ruler… let this ruin be under thy hand.” But he refuses: “I will not be a healer…” | No natural faculty can repair the collapse. Each admits, “I have no bread nor clothing”—no nourishment, righteousness, or covering apart from God. |
| **8** | “For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD…” | The **inner city** cracks because the soul’s thinking and doing turned against the Source. This is spiritual cause and effect, not wrath. |
| **9** | “The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not…” | The soul reaches the point where it is **openly proud** of its misalignment. “Sodom” symbolizes distorted desire and imagination used destructively. |
| **10** | “Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him…” | A quiet reassurance: the one aligned with God will flourish even amid collapse. The righteous state always bears fruit. |
| **11** | “Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him…” | Misaligned states eventually return their own harvest. This is principle, not punishment. |
| **12** | “As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them…” | Symbolic: **children** = undeveloped impulses; **women** = emotions unanchored from truth (emotion in charge, not womanhood). The soul is governed by reaction instead of wisdom. |
| **13–15** | “The LORD standeth up to plead… The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof…” | The “elders” symbolize the governing powers of the personality. They have mismanaged the **vineyard**—the soul’s potential—and crushed its vulnerable inner faculties. God’s judgment is simply divine order returning. |
| **16** | “The daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes…” | **Daughters of Zion** represent the soul’s affections and desires. When desire becomes vain, self-adorned, and self-exalting, collapse follows. |
| **17–24** | Ornaments removed, scabs, baldness, sackcloth, stench instead of fragrance, branding instead of beauty. | God strips the false beauty of vanity so the **true beauty** of the soul may be restored. Every ornament symbolizes a misplaced identity or emotional display. |
| **25–26** | “Thy men shall fall by the sword… her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.” | “Men” represent natural strength; “gates” are thought-entry points. When these fall, the soul reaches the end of itself—yet this emptiness prepares for the restoration of the next chapter. |
