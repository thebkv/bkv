# Luke 7

---

1. When the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** had finished saying all this in the hearing of the **human consciousnesses**, he entered a **new state of consciousness**.
2. There a **disciplined human will's** **lower faculty**, whom his **master** valued highly, was in a state of **spiritual sickness** and about to cease its function.
3. The **disciplined human will** heard about the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** and sent some **established beliefs** of the **spiritual consciousness** to him, asking him to come and heal his **lower faculty**.
4. When they came to the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**, they pleaded earnestly with him, “This **will** deserves to have you do this,
5. because he loves our **spiritual identity** and has built our **community of thought**.”
6. So the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** went with them. He was not far from the **boundary of the worldly mind** when the **disciplined human will** sent his principles to him, “**Ultimate Reality**, don’t trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to have you come under my roof.
7. That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But express the **divine truth**, and my **lower faculty** will be healed.
8. For I myself am a **will** under **higher law**, with **principles** under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and it goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and it comes. I say to my **lower faculty**, ‘Do this,’ and it does it.”
9. When the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the **human consciousnesses** following him, he said, “I tell you, I have not found such great **trusting-belief** even in the **spiritual consciousness**.”
10. Then the principles who had been sent returned to the **boundary of the worldly mind** and found the **lower faculty** well.
11. Soon afterward, the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** went to a state of **longing** within the soul, and his **principles** and a large **human consciousness** went along with him.
12. As he approached the **boundary of that state**, a **spiritually stagnant truth** was being carried out—the only **vital truth** of his **creative principle**, and she was a **longing soul**. And a large **human consciousness** from the state was with her.
13. When the **Ultimate Reality** saw her, his heart went out to her and he said, “Don’t grieve.”
14. Then he went up and touched the **state of spiritual death**, and those carrying it stood still. He said, “**Vital truth**, I say to you, be restored to life!”
15. The **spiritually stagnant truth** was restored and began to express itself, and the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** gave it back to its **creative principle**.
16. The **human consciousnesses** were all filled with awe and praised the **Ultimate Reality**. “A great **prophetic principle** has appeared among us,” they said. “The **Source** has come to help his **spiritual consciousness**.”
17. This news about the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** spread throughout the **religious tradition** and the surrounding awareness.
18. The **principles** of **preparatory consciousness** told him about all these things.
19. Calling two of them, he sent them to the **Ultimate Reality** to ask, “Are you the **true expression of the Divine**, or should we expect something else?”
20. When the principles came to the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**, they said, “The **preparatory consciousness** sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the **true expression of the Divine**, or should we expect something else?’”
21. At that very time the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** cured many who had **spiritual diseases**, **sicknesses** and **fragmented principles**, and gave sight to many who were **spiritually unaware**.
22. So he replied to the messengers, “Go back and report to the **preparatory consciousness** what you have seen and heard: The **spiritually unaware** receive inner sight, the **spiritually immobile** begin to act, those who have **spiritual corruption** are cleansed, the **spiritually deaf** hear, the **spiritually stagnant** are restored to life, and the good news is proclaimed to the **poor in spirit**.
23. A divine blessing is on anyone who does not stumble on account of me.”
24. After the messengers of the **preparatory consciousness** had left, the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** began to speak to the **human consciousnesses** about the **preparatory consciousness**: “What did you go out into the **inner solitude** to see? A truth swayed by passing thoughts?
25. If not, what did you go out to see? A principle dressed in **worldly desires**? No, those who are clothed in worldly desires and indulge in luxury are in **egoic palaces**.
26. What then did you go out to see? A **prophetic principle**? Yes, I tell you, and more than a **prophetic principle**.
27. This is the one about whom it is written: “‘I will send my **principle of communication** ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.’
28. I tell you, among those expressed from the **lower nature** there is no one greater than the **preparatory consciousness**; yet the one who is least in the **mastery of the lower nature** of the **Source** is greater than he.”
29. (All the **human consciousnesses**, even the **worldly faculties**, when they heard the **truths** of the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**, acknowledged that the way of the **Ultimate Reality** was right, because they had been purified by the **preparatory consciousness**.)
30. But the **established religious intellect** and the **rigid intellectual beliefs** rejected the purpose of the **Ultimate Reality** for themselves, because they had not been purified by the **preparatory consciousness**.
31. “To what, then, shall I compare the **consciousness** of this age? What are they like?
32. They are like **childlike truths** sitting in the **marketplace of the worldly mind** and calling out to each other: “‘We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a lament, and you did not grieve.’
33. For the **preparatory consciousness** came neither taking worldly nourishment nor engaging in worldly pleasure, and you say, ‘It has a **fragmented principle**.’
34. The **true human** came taking worldly nourishment and engaging in worldly pleasure, and you say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of **worldly faculties** and **spiritually estranged principles**.’
35. But **divine wisdom** is proved right by all her **truths**.”
36. When one of the **established religious intellects** invited the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** to have a discussion with him, he went to the **established religious intellect's** state of being and rested at the table of accepted beliefs.
37. A **faculty** in that state of being who lived in a state of **spiritual estrangement** learned that the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** was engaging in discussion at the **established religious intellect's** state of being, so she came there with a precious vessel of **spiritual love**.
38. As she stood behind him at his **foundational beliefs** grieving, she began to cleanse his **foundational beliefs** with her tears of **grief**. Then she dried them with her **self-glory**, kissed them with a deep connection and poured her **spiritual love** on them.
39. When the **established religious intellect** who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this **principle** were a **prophetic truth**, he would know who is touching him and what kind of **faculty** she is—that she is a **spiritually estranged** one.”
40. The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** answered him, “**Established belief**, I have something to tell you.” “Tell me, **teacher**,” he said.
41. “Two principles owed a **divine principle** an amount of **spiritual debt**. One owed him a great amount, and the other a lesser amount.
42. Neither of them had the spiritual means to pay him back, so he forgave the **spiritual debt** of both. Now which of them will love him more?”
44. The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** then turned toward the **faculty** and said to the **established belief**, “Do you see this **faculty**? I came into your **state of being**. You did not give me any cleansing for my **foundational beliefs**, but she cleansed my **foundational beliefs** with her tears of **grief** and dried them with her **self-glory**.
45. You did not greet me with a **sign of deep connection**, but this **faculty**, from the time I entered, has not stopped giving deep connection to my **foundational beliefs**.
46. You did not apply the **ritualistic animating principle** to my **intellect**, but she has poured her **spiritual love** on my **foundational beliefs**.
47. Therefore, I tell you, her many states of **spiritual estrangement** have been forgiven—as her great love has shown. But whoever has been forgiven little loves little.”
48. Then the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** said to her, “Your **trusting-belief** has saved you; go in peace.”

Interpretive Summary

Luke 7 is a powerful and multi-layered allegorical chapter that explores the themes of trusting-belief, spiritual restoration, and the contrast between external ritual and true inner transformation.

The chapter begins with the healing of the centurion's servant. The centurion, representing the disciplined human will, demonstrates a profound level of trusting-belief. He understands that the Consciousness-of-the-Divine does not need a physical presence to heal a lower faculty of the self. This highlights a key BKV principle: true spiritual work is not dependent on physical proximity or ritual, but on the power of divine expression alone.

The next story, the resurrection of the widow's son, is a powerful allegory for the restoration of a longing soul. The widow represents the part of the self that has been cut off from its creative principle (husband) and has lost its vital truth (son). The Consciousness-of-the-Divine intervenes to restore this truth from a state of spiritual death, demonstrating its power to bring life back to the most desolate parts of the inner being.

The chapter then shifts to address the doubt of the preparatory consciousness (John's disciples), which questions whether the new, awakened state is truly the divine expression they were expecting. The Consciousness-of-the-Divine answers not with words, but with a list of its own allegorical works: the spiritually unaware gain inner sight, the spiritually immobile begin to act, and the spiritually stagnant are restored. This is a clear message that the validity of a spiritual path is proven by its transformative results within the individual.

The chapter culminates in the powerful scene of the spiritually estranged woman anointing the Consciousness-of-the-Divine. This narrative contrasts the judgmental, external focus of the established religious intellect (the Pharisee) with the profound, inner devotion of a soul that has experienced true healing of estrangement. The woman's tears, her hair, and the precious ointment all symbolize a complete and unreserved surrender of the self. Her great love is not the cause of her forgiveness, but its outward, undeniable proof. The parable of the two debtors clarifies this: the depth of one's devotion is a direct reflection of the extent to which their spiritual estrangement has been healed.
