# **Philippians 1 — BKV Study**  
### *Joy, Partnership, and the God Who Completes What He Begins*

---

# **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

1. Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,  
   to all the **saints** in Christ Jesus who are at **Philippi**,  
   with the overseers and deacons:

2. Grace to you and peace  
   from God our Father  
   and the Lord Jesus Christ.

---

## **Thanksgiving and Partnership**

3. I thank my God  
   upon every remembrance of you,

4. Always in every prayer of mine for you all  
   making my request with **joy**,

5. For your **partnership in the gospel**  
   from the first day until now.

6. Being confident of this very thing:  
   that He who began a **good work** in you  
   will **complete it**  
   until the day of Christ Jesus.

7. It is right for me to think this of you all,  
   because I have you in my heart,  
   in my chains  
   and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel,  
   you are all **partakers of grace** with me.

8. For God is my witness,  
   how I long for you all  
   with the **affections** of Christ Jesus.

## **Paul’s Prayer for Their Growth**

9. And this I pray,  
   that your **love** may abound yet more and more,  
   in **knowledge** and in **discernment**,

10. That you may approve the things that are **excellent**,  
    and be **sincere** and **blameless**  
    until the day of Christ,

11. Being filled with the **fruit of righteousness**,  
    through Jesus Christ,  
    to the glory and praise of God.

---

## **Chains, Christ, and Unshakable Purpose**

12. I want you to know, brethren,  
    that the things which happened to me  
    have turned out for the **advancement of the gospel**.

13. So that my chains in Christ  
    have become well-known throughout the whole praetorium  
    and to all the rest.

14. And many of the brethren in the Lord,  
    encouraged by my chains,  
    are much more bold  
    to speak the word without fear.

15. Some indeed preach Christ out of envy and rivalry,  
    but others out of goodwill.

16. The former preach Christ from selfish ambition,  
    not sincerely,  
    supposing to add affliction to my chains;

17. But the latter out of love,  
    knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.

18. What then?  
    Only that in every way,  
    whether in pretense or in truth,  
    Christ is preached;  
    and in this I **rejoice**,  
    yes, and will rejoice.

## **Life, Death, and the Gain of Christ**

19. For I know that this will turn to my deliverance  
    through your prayer  
    and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

20. According to my earnest expectation and hope  
    that in nothing I shall be ashamed,  
    but that with all boldness,  
    Christ shall be magnified in my body,  
    whether by life or by death.

21. For to me,  
    **to live is Christ**,  
    and **to die is gain**.

22. But if I live in the flesh,  
    this means fruitful labor for me;  
    yet what I shall choose I cannot tell.

23. I am torn between the two:  
    having a desire to depart and be with Christ,  
    which is far better,

24. Yet to remain in the flesh  
    is more needful for your sake.

25. And being convinced of this,  
    I know that I shall remain and continue with you all  
    for your progress and joy in the faith,

26. So that your rejoicing for me  
    may be more abundant in Christ Jesus  
    by my coming to you again.

## **A Worthy Walk**

27. Only let your conduct be **worthy of the gospel of Christ**,  
    so that whether I come and see you  
    or remain absent,  
    I may hear of your affairs:  

    that you stand fast  
    in **one spirit**,  
    with **one mind**,  
    striving together  
    for the faith of the gospel;

28. And in nothing terrified by your adversaries,  
    which to them is evidence of destruction,  
    but to you of salvation —  
    and that from God.

29. For unto you it has been granted  
    on behalf of Christ,  
    not only to believe in Him,  
    but also to **suffer** for His sake,

30. Having the same conflict  
    which you saw in me,  
    and now hear to be in me.

# **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**  
### *Poetic Alignment*

- Joy is not an emotion — it is **agreement with God’s work already underway**.

- The good work begins in you,  
  but its completion is **in His hands**.

- Partnership in the gospel  
  is the knitting of souls  
  around a shared mission.

- Chains do not hinder the gospel —  
  they amplify it.

- Christ is preached  
  even through flawed motives —  
  because Christ is unstoppable.

- “To live is Christ” —  
  life becomes **a conduit**.  
  “To die is gain” —  
  death becomes **a doorway**.

- Unity of mind  
  is the fruit of unity of purpose.

- Suffering is not punishment —  
  it is participation.

# **Summary / Commentary**

### **1. This is Paul’s most joyful letter — written in chains.**  
Philippians 1 immediately reveals the paradox of Christian maturity:  
**Joy is not circumstantial; it is relational.**

### **2. God completes what He starts.**  
Verse 6 is a foundation stone of the Christian life:  
your transformation begins with God,  
continues with God,  
and is finished by God.

### **3. Unity flows from shared purpose.**  
The Philippians are “of one mind” because they are “striving together for the gospel.”  
Purpose produces unity.

### **4. Suffering is reframed as participation, not failure.**  
Verse 29 expresses one of the deepest truths:  
you are *granted* to suffer with Christ,  
meaning your suffering is not lost — it is woven into Him.

### **5. Paul models the God-centered life.**  
Whether by life or death,  
his singular desire is that **Christ be magnified in his body**.
