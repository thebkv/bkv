# Romans 11 KJV to BKV

| **KJV** | **BKV — Narrative Reading** |
|---|---|
| **1** I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid… | God has not rejected the **Overcomer-People** within you. The inner faculties God awakened are never discarded. |
| **2** God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew… | The Source never abandons the true inner self He planted. Even when the outer mind grows confused, the root remains known. |
| **3** Lord, they have killed thy prophets… | Like **Elijah** (Fiery Discernment), the soul often assumes it is alone in faith, overwhelmed by the noise of the natural mind. |
| **4** I have reserved to myself seven thousand… | God preserves a **hidden remnant**—the part of you that never bowed to **Baal** (the false master, self-governance without God). |
| **5** Even so then at this present time… | So it is now: there remains in every soul a preserved, grace-chosen remnant of pure intention. |
| **6** And if by grace… | This remnant lives by **favor**, not effort. Grace and self-earning cannot mix. |
| **7** Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh… | The **natural mind** could not grasp what the spiritual mind received. The surface self missed what the deeper self knew. |
| **8** God hath given them the spirit of slumber… | A **spiritual fog** settles over the intellect when it trusts itself too much—eyes unseeing, ears unhearing. |
| **9–10** Let their table be made a snare… | The very system the soul relied on becomes its trap; self-confidence collapses into spiritual numbness. |
| **11** Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid… | Their fall was not final—it opened a doorway for the **Nations** (the outer, untrained faculties) to receive grace. |
| **12** If their fall be the riches of the world… | The failure of the inner ego became enrichment for the outer life. How much greater the fullness when restored! |
| **13–14** I magnify mine office… | Paul (the Enlightened Will) speaks to awaken jealousy in the dormant inner man—to stir him back to life. |
| **15** What shall the receiving of them be… | The restoration of the inner man is **life from the dead**—the return of spiritual vitality. |
| **16** If the root be holy… | The **Root** (the Divine Source) determines holiness. Everything connected to the root receives life. |
| **17** Thou, being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in… | The **wild faculties**—untutored, unrefined parts of the soul—are grafted into the living structure by grace. |
| **18** Boast not against the branches… | Do not exalt one faculty over another. You do not support the root—the Root supports you. |
| **19–20** Because of unbelief they were broken off… | Pride disconnects; humility reconnects. Faith is posture, not performance. |
| **21** If God spared not the natural branches… | No faculty is immune to pruning. Every part of the soul must stay surrendered to remain alive. |
| **22** Behold the goodness and severity of God… | Severity removes pride; kindness preserves growth. Both operate for healing. |
| **23** God is able to graft them in again. | Restoration is always possible. No branch is beyond reattachment. |
| **24** Grafted contrary to nature… | If the wild could be grafted in, much more the original—God’s order works backward and forward. |
| **25** Blindness in part is happened to Israel… | The inner ego experienced partial blindness until the rest of the soul awakened. |
| **26** And so all Israel shall be saved… | The **whole person**—inner and outer—will be brought into unity. Salvation is integration. |
| **27** This is my covenant unto them… | God rewrites the heart, removing the old ungodliness. This is inner restoration. |
| **28–29** Beloved for the fathers’ sakes… | Even resistant parts of the soul remain loved; the gifts and calling cannot be revoked. |
| **30–31** Through your mercy they also may obtain mercy… | One part of the soul awakens another. Every fall becomes a channel for mercy. |
| **32** God hath concluded them all in unbelief… | All were shut up in limitation so that mercy could reach all. This is the symmetry of grace. |
| **33** O the depth… | God’s wisdom is unfathomable. His paths cannot be traced through human logic. |
| **34–35** Who hath known the mind of the Lord… | The soul contributes nothing to God—everything it receives is gift. |
| **36** For of him, and through him, and to him… | All things begin in God, move through God, and return to God. To Him be glory forever. |
