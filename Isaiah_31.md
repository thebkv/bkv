# **Isaiah 31 — BKV Study (The Principle of Singular Dependence)**
### *The Folly of Trusting the Manifested Domain*

---

> _“Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the Lord!”_ — Isaiah 31:1 KJV
> _“Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit.”_ — Isaiah 31:3 KJV

*The **Core Truth** demands absolute **Singular Dependence** on the **Source**. Consciousness commits **Misplaced Causality** whenever it seeks power or security from the **Manifested Domain** (**Egypt**) or relies upon **Self-Generated Strength** (**Horses**). The **Source** alone possesses the **Power** to defend the **Inner Sanctuary**.*

## **BKV-NR Context — Trusting Flesh Over Spirit**

**Isaiah 31** is a direct prophetic warning against the ultimate form of **Misplaced Causality**: trusting the **Manifested Domain (Egypt)** over the **Eternal Source**. The nation's error of relying on Egyptian military strength mirrors the consciousness's fundamental error of relying on its own **unassisted will** or **external resources** (intellect, wealth, physical strength) for spiritual security and resolution. The chapter enforces the metaphysical distinction between **flesh (fragmented power)** and **spirit (singular power)**, declaring that reliance on the former results in the fall of both the helper and the helped.

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

### **The Woe of Misplaced Trust**

1. Woe to them that go down to **Manifested Domain (Egypt)** for help; and stay on **Self-Generated Strength (horses)**, and trust in **External Resources (chariots)**, because they are many; but they look not unto the **Holy One of Israel** (The Source), neither seek the **Source**.
3. Now the **Manifested Domain (Egyptian)** is **Fragmented Man**, and not **Eternal Source**; and their **Self-Generated Strength (horses)** is **Flesh**, and not **Spirit**. When the **Source** shall stretch out His hand, both he that **helps** (external resource) and he that is **helped** (the relying will) shall fall together.

### **The Source’s Defense**

4. For thus has the **Source** spoken unto me, Like as the **Lion** (irresistible force) roaring on his prey... so shall the **Lord of Hosts (Source’s Power)** come down to fight for **Mount Zion** (Elevated Consciousness), and for the **Hill thereof** (Inner Sanctuary).
5. As **Birds Flying** (constant, tireless watchfulness), so will the **Lord of Hosts** defend **Jerusalem** (Peace/Wholeness); defending also He will deliver it; and passing over He will preserve it.
6. Turn ye unto him from whom the **Elect Faculties (Children of Israel)** have deeply revolted.
7. For in that day every man shall cast away his **Idols of Silver** and his **Idols of Gold** (attachments to self-glory), which your own hands have made unto you for a sin.

## **Commentary on the Action**

### **1 · Flesh vs. Spirit (vv 1, 3)**
The core distinction is drawn: the power of the **Manifested Domain (Egypt)** is **Flesh**—inherently fragmented and transient. The **Source's** power is **Spirit**—singular and eternal. Reliance on "horses" represents the **Lower Faculty's** attempt to solve spiritual problems using **Self-Generated Strength** (e.g., intellectual schemes, willpower, material wealth). This act breaks the **Law of Singular Dependence** and guarantees the failure of both the external support and the relying consciousness.

### **2 · Irresistible Defense (vv 4–5)**
The **Source's Power** is described as a **Lion** and **Birds Flying**, symbolizing a fierce, absolute, and tireless defense of the **Inner Sanctuary (Jerusalem/Zion)**. This defense is not contingent upon the size of the external threat but upon the singular authority of the **Source**. This assures the aligned consciousness that once the **Principle of Singular Dependence** is chosen, protection is automatic.

### **3 · The Casting Away of Idols (v 7)**
The final act of turning back to the Source is the conscious rejection of **Idols of Silver and Gold**—the **attachments to self-glory** and the pursuit of **self-generated merit** that the **Lower Faculty** creates by its own effort. The moment the will ceases to seek glory from external or self-derived sources, true alignment begins.

## **Scriptural Cross References**

| Reference | BKV Theme Link | Connection to Isaiah 31 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Exodus 20:3** | **Singularity of Cause** | The reliance on **Egypt/Horses** is a direct violation of the foundational Law: having other "gods" (secondary, fragmented powers) before the Source. |
| **Romans 8:5–8** | **Mind Fixed on Manifestation** | The decision to trust **Flesh** (v. 3) is the operation of the **Carnal Mind**, which is hostile to the Source and cannot receive the **Law of the Spirit of Life**. |
| **Psalm 20:7** | **Trust in Names** | "Some trust in **chariots**, and some in **horses**: but we will remember the name of the Lord our God." A direct thematic parallel to the danger of trusting external strength. |
| **1 Corinthians 1:19–20** | **Nullification of Wisdom** | The **Source** choosing **weak things** nullifies the strength of **horses/chariots**—the **Human Wisdom** that the Source has chosen to confound. |

## **Core BKV Principle**
> *The path to **Alignment** requires the cessation of **Self-Generated Strength** and the abandonment of the **Manifested Domain** as a source of help. **Spiritual Security** is founded on **Singular Dependence**—the absolute truth that the **Eternal Source** alone possesses the **Power** to defend the **Inner Sanctuary**.*
