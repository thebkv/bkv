# Isaiah 4 — BKV (Traditional Layout)
## *The Cleansing, the Covering, and the Restoration of the Inner City*

---

## **Summary**
After the collapse of self-made identity in Isaiah 3, Isaiah 4 reveals what God builds in its place.  
It is the re-creation of the inner life: a purified Jerusalem, a cleansed consciousness, a restored identity, and a divine covering.

The chapter moves in three steps:

1. **The desperate grasp of the old identity** (v.1).  
2. **The emergence of the Branch**—Christ within—cleansing and purifying (vv.2–4).  
3. **The restored inner city under God’s own cloud and fire** (vv.5–6).  

It is a miniature resurrection story.  
The false self collapses; the true self arises.

# **Isaiah 4 — KJV / BKV Comparison Table**

| Verse | KJV Text | BKV (Bible Key Version) |
|-------|----------|-------------------------|
| **1** | “And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.” | The **affections** (seven = completeness) try to cling to a single “man” — the old identity — insisting on keeping their **own bread** (their own understanding) and **own apparel** (their own self-made righteousness). They want the *name* without the transformation. This is the soul’s last attempt to hold onto ego. |
| **2** | “In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious…” | The **Branch** symbolizes the emergence of **Christ within**, the true spiritual life springing forth after the collapse. What grows here is beautiful, glorious, and fruitful — unlike the withered self-made structures of chapter 3. |
| **3** | “He that is left in Zion… shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem…” | Whatever **survives** the purification — whatever is truly of God — is called **holy**. This is the refined inner identity, written “among the living,” meaning aligned with the Life of God. |
| **4** | “When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem… by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning.” | The cleansing is twofold: **judgment** (truth clearing out distortion) and **burning** (the Spirit consuming all that cannot remain). The desires (“daughters of Zion”) and the inner city (“Jerusalem”) are purified entirely. |
| **5** | “And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion… a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night…” | God establishes a **divine covering** over the whole inner life. The cloud and fire recall Exodus: guidance, protection, and presence. The soul becomes a new wilderness tabernacle — directed, sheltered, illuminated. |
| **6** | “And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the heat… and for a covert from storm and from rain.” | The restored soul becomes a **sanctuary**: protected from heat (outer pressures), storm (inner turmoil), and rain (soaking troubles). God Himself becomes the covering of the renewed consciousness. |
