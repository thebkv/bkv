# Exodus 5 — BKV

---  
_“Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.”_
---  


1.  Afterward the **Principle of Divine Law** and the **Principle of Expression** went and said to the **Egoic Will**, “Thus says the **Ultimate Reality**, the **Source** of the **Aspects of the Soul**: ‘Let my **Aspects of the Soul** go, that they may hold a **spiritual feast** to me in the **inner solitude**.’”
2.  But the **Egoic Will** said, “Who is the **Ultimate Reality**, that I should obey his **Core Truth** and let the **Aspects of the Soul** go? I do not know the **Ultimate Reality**, and I will not let the **Aspects of the Soul** go.”
3.  Then they said, “The **Source of the Inner Life** has met with us. Please let us go three **cycles of experience** into the **inner solitude**, that we may hold a **spiritual feast** to the **Ultimate Reality**, lest he fall upon us with **spiritual suffering** or with the **loss of vitality**.”
4.  But the **Egoic Will**, the ruler of the **state of bondage**, said to them, “**Principle of Divine Law** and **Principle of Expression**, why do you take the **Aspects of the Soul** away from their **egoic work**? Get back to your **burdensome tasks**!”
5.  And the **Egoic Will** said, “Behold, the **Aspects of the Soul** are now numerous in the land, and yet you would make them rest from their **burdensome tasks**!”
6.  The same day the **Egoic Will** commanded the **egoic taskmasters** and their **cooperative inner faculties**,
7.  “You shall no longer give the **Aspects of the Soul** **spiritual sustenance** to make **works of self-effort** as before; let them go and gather **spiritual sustenance** for themselves.
8.  But the number of **works of self-effort** that they made previously you shall still lay upon them; you shall not reduce it, for they are idle. Therefore they cry, ‘Let us go and hold a **spiritual feast** to our **Source**.’
9.  Let heavier **egoic work** be laid on the **Aspects of the Soul**, that they may labor in it and pay no attention to **false words**.”
10. So the **egoic taskmasters** and the **cooperative inner faculties** went out and said to the **Aspects of the Soul**, “Thus says the **Egoic Will**: I will not give you **spiritual sustenance**!
11. Go and get your **spiritual sustenance** yourselves, wherever you can find it, but your **works of self-effort** will not be reduced.”
12. So the **Aspects of the Soul** were scattered throughout all the **state of bondage** to gather stubble for **spiritual sustenance**.
13. The **egoic taskmasters** were urgent, saying, “Complete your **works**! Complete your daily task, just as when there was **spiritual sustenance**!”
14. And the **cooperative inner faculties** of the **Aspects of the Soul**, whom the **egoic taskmasters** had set over them, were beaten and were asked, “Why have you not completed your fixed measure of **works of self-effort** yesterday and today, as before?”
15. Then the **cooperative inner faculties** of the **Aspects of the Soul** came and cried to the **Egoic Will**, “Why do you deal thus with your **Aspects of the Soul**?
16. No **spiritual sustenance** is given to your **Aspects of the Soul**, yet they say to us, ‘Make **works of self-effort**!’ And behold, your **Aspects of the Soul** are beaten, but the fault is in your own **Egoic Will**.”
17. But the **Egoic Will** said, “You are idle! Idle! Therefore you say, ‘Let us go and hold a **spiritual feast** to the **Ultimate Reality**.’
18. Go now and work. No **spiritual sustenance** will be given you, but you must deliver the fixed measure of **works of self-effort**.”
19. The **cooperative inner faculties** of the **Aspects of the Soul** saw that they were in trouble when they were told, “You shall not reduce your fixed measure of **works of self-effort**.”
20. They met the **Principle of Divine Law** and the **Principle of Expression**, who were waiting for them as they came out from the **Egoic Will**.
21. And they said to them, “The **Source of the Inner Life** look upon you and **judge** you, because you have made us **hated** in the eyes of the **Egoic Will** and in the eyes of his **principles**, by putting a **sharp weapon** in their hand to **put us to an end**.”
22. Then the **Principle of Divine Law** returned to the **Ultimate Reality** and said, “O **Source**, why have you done evil to these **Aspects of the Soul**? Why did you ever send me?
23. For since I came to the **Egoic Will** to speak in your name, he has done evil to these **Aspects of the Soul**, and you have not rescued your **Aspects of the Soul** at all.”

### Interpretive Insights

**I.1. The Egoic Will’s Question (Exod 5:2):** The Egoic Will (**Pharaoh**) responds to the Law's demand with "Who is the Lord...?" This signifies the **fundamental state of alienation and ignorance** of the Divine Source that defines the ego. The ego does not recognize any authority higher than itself.

**I.2. Denial of Sustenance, Demand for Works (Exod 5:7-8):** The Egoic Will retaliates against the call for freedom by removing the **spiritual sustenance (straw)** but demanding the fixed quota of **works of self-effort (bricks)**. This allegorically represents a state of **works-based consciousness**—where the soul is forced to perform spiritual actions without the necessary spiritual **grace** or **inner support**.

**I.3. The Cooperative Inner Faculties (Exod 5:14):** The **cooperative inner faculties** (the Israelite foremen) symbolize the parts of the soul that have become compromised and function *within* the ego's system of bondage. They are the first to suffer the painful consequences when the system is challenged, leading them to blame the liberating principle (**Moses**) instead of the oppressor.

**I.4. The Law's Immediate Doubt (Exod 5:22-23):** The immediate failure causes the **Principle of Divine Law (Moses)** to question its mission. This shows that even the highest spiritual principles, when first engaged in worldly action, can be shaken by the **apparent worsening of the inner state** (the increased oppression).
