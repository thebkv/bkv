1 Now these are the people of the province who came up out of **Confusion — the state of exile and separation**. They had been carried away by **Nebuchadnezzar — prophecy of confusion’s power**, king of **Confusion**, and returned to **Foundation of Peace** and Judah, each to his own city.  

2 They came with **Seed of Babylon — scattered in confusion, now leading restoration**, Jeshua (**Yahweh saves**), Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah.  

The number of the men of the people of Israel:  

3–20 [Various families are listed, each name carrying its own meaning, returning from separation back to the inheritance of God.]  

21–35 The children of **Bethlehem — House of Bread**, Netophah, Anathoth, Azmaveth, Kirjath-arim, Chephirah, Beeroth, Ramah, Gaba, Michmas, Bethel and Ai, Nebo, Magbish, Elam, Harim, Lod, Hadid, Ono, Jericho, and Senaah.  

36–39 The priests: the sons of Jedaiah, Immer, Pashhur, and Harim.  

40 The Levites: the sons of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the sons of Hodaviah.  
41 The singers: the sons of Asaph — the **voices of praise, harmonics of the soul**.  
42 The gatekeepers: the sons of Shallum, Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita, and Shobai — the **guardians of the entrances of consciousness**.  

43–54 The temple servants: the sons of Ziha, Hasupha, Tabbaoth, Keros, Siaha, Padon, Lebanah, Hagabah, Akkub, Hagab, Shalmai, Hanan, Giddel, Gahar, Reaiah, Rezin, Nekoda, Gazzam, Uzza, Paseah, Besai, Asnah, Meunim, Nephisim, Bakbuk, Hakupha, Harhur, Bazluth, Mehida, Harsha, Barkos, Sisera, Temah, Neziah, and Hatipha — **dedicated faculties, set apart for holy use**.  

55–58 The sons of Solomon’s servants: Sotai, Sophereth, Peruda, Jaalah, Darkon, Giddel, Shephatiah, Hattil, Pochereth of Zebaim, and Ami. All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon’s servants were three hundred and ninety-two.  

59–60 And these were they who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer; but they could not prove their fathers’ houses or their descent, whether they were of Israel.  

61–63 Of the sons of the priests: Habaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai (who had taken a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called by their name). These sought their registration among those enrolled in the genealogies, but they were not found; so they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean.  

And the governor told them they should not eat of the most holy food until a priest stood with **Urim and Thummim — lights and perfections, divine clarity and truth**.  

64 The whole congregation together was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty,  

65 besides their male and female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven; and they had two hundred male and female singers.  

66 Their horses were seven hundred thirty-six, their mules two hundred forty-five,  

67 their camels four hundred thirty-five, their donkeys six thousand seven hundred and twenty.  

68 When they came to the house of the LORD at **Foundation of Peace**, some of the heads of fathers’ houses made freewill offerings for the house of God, to set it in its place.  

69 According to their ability they gave to the treasury sixty-one thousand darics of gold, five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestly garments.  

70 So the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, the temple servants, and some of the people lived in their towns, and all Israel in their towns.
