## BKV-NR (Natural Reading)

1. My **Principle of Self (Son)**, forget not my **Divine Law (Torah)**; but let your **Center of Will (heart)** keep my **Active Mandates (Commandments)**:
2. For length of **Inner Days**, and **Spiritual Peace**, shall they add to you.
3. Let not **Enduring Mercy** and **Inner Truth** forsake you: bind them about your **Inner Neck**; write them upon the **Tablet of your Center of Will**:
5. **Trust** in the **Self-Existent Reality** with all your **Center of Will**; and lean not unto your own **Inner Understanding**.
6. In all your **Spiritual Paths** acknowledge **Him**, and **He** shall direct your **Spiritual Conduct**.
7. Be not **Principle of Inner Wisdom** in your own **Inner Sight**: **Fear** the **Self-Existent Reality**, and depart from **Spiritual Disorder (evil)**.
8. It shall be **Inner Health** to your **Inner Being**, and **Vitality** to your **Inner Principles**.
9. **Honor** the **Self-Existent Reality** with your **Inner Resources (substance)**, and with the **Highest Efforts** of all your **Inner Increase**:
10. So shall your **Inner Storehouses** be filled with **Spiritual Abundance**, and your **Inner Presses** shall burst out with **New Wine**.
11. My **Principle of Self**, despise not the **Inner Discipline (chastening)** of the **Self-Existent Reality**; neither be weary of **His Correction**:
12. For whom the **Self-Existent Reality** loves **He** corrects; even as a father the **Principle of Self** in whom he delights.
13. Happy is the **Aspect of the Soul** that finds **Principle of Inner Wisdom**, and the **Aspect of the Soul** that gets **Inner Understanding**.
16. **Length of Inner Days** is in her right **Principle of Action**; and in her left **Principle of Action** **Spiritual Riches** and **Honor**.
17. Her **Spiritual Paths** are **Spiritual Paths of Pleasantness**, and all her **Inner Roads** are **Inner Peace**.
18. **She** is a **Tree of Inner Life** to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retains her.

## Commentary on the Action

Proverbs 3 outlines the fundamental psychological relationship between the individual soul and the **Divine Source**. It mandates a move away from self-reliance (leaning on **Inner Understanding**) toward **Total Trust** in the **Self-Existent Reality**. The chapter is structured around a cause-and-effect relationship: *obeying* the **Active Mandates** leads to **Spiritual Peace** and **Spiritual Abundance** (v. 10). Conversely, failure results in necessary **Inner Discipline** (v. 11). The ultimate reward is **Lady Wisdom (Principle of Inner Wisdom)** itself, which provides the **Tree of Inner Life** and permanent **Inner Peace**.

## Interpretive Insights

**I.1. The Primacy of Trust Over Ego (Proverbs 3:5-7):** This is the core instruction for the initiation of the spiritual life. The BKV sees "understanding" as the **Ego's Inner Sight**—the limited, rational, and unilluminated faculty of the outer mind. The command is to **de-center the ego** by giving the **Center of Will (heart)** entirely to the **Divine Source**. Acknowledging the Divine in **all your Spiritual Paths** means every thought, decision, and action must be consecrated, thereby making the entire life a directed, purposeful movement toward the Divine.

**I.2. Honoring with Inner Resources (Proverbs 3:9-10):** Honoring the Lord with "substance and firstfruits" is not a command for material wealth. It is a demand for the dedication of the **highest inner resources**.
* **Substance:** All accumulated **Inner Resources** (time, energy, talents).
* **Firstfruits:** The **Highest Efforts** or the first, most pristine moment of any creative process or spiritual energy.
The consequence—filled storehouses and new wine—is the promised internal reward: **Spiritual Abundance** and the overflowing, vibrant energy of **New Spiritual Life** that naturally results from prioritizing the Divine.

**I.3. Inner Discipline as Divine Correction (Proverbs 3:11-12):** The BKV interprets "chastening" or "correction" as necessary **Inner Discipline** from the **Divine Source**, not arbitrary punishment. When the **Principle of Self** deviates (as described in v. 7), the resultant pain or struggle is the Divine mechanism of **Correction** operating to guide the soul back to the **Divine Law**. This correction is proof of Divine love ("whom the Lord loves He corrects"), serving as an act of inner fatherhood toward the developing spiritual **Principle of Self**.
