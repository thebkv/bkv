# 1 Corinthians 15 — BKV Study  
### *The Resurrection, the New Creation, and the Final Victory*

---

# **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

## **The Core Message**

1. Moreover, brethren,  
   I declare to you the **good news** which I preached to you,  
   which you received,  
   in which you stand,

2. By which also you are saved,  
   if you hold fast the word I preached to you —  
   unless you believed in vain.

3. For I delivered to you first of all  
   what I also received:  
   that **Christ died for our sins**  
   according to the Scriptures;

4. And that He was **buried**,  
   and that He **rose again the third day**  
   according to the Scriptures;

5. And that He was seen by **Cephas**,  
   then by the **twelve**.

6. After that He was seen by more than **five hundred** at once…

8. Last of all He was seen by me also,  
   as by **one untimely born**.

## **If There Is No Resurrection…**

12. Now if Christ is preached  
    that He rose from the dead,  
    how do some of you say  
    that there is **no resurrection of the dead**?

13. If there is no resurrection,  
    then Christ is not risen.

14. And if Christ is not risen,  
    then our preaching is empty,  
    and your faith is empty.

17. And if Christ is not raised,  
    your faith is futile;  
    you are still in your sins.

19. If in this life only we have hope in Christ,  
    we are of all men most miserable.

## **But Now…**

20. But now **Christ is risen from the dead**,  
    and has become the **firstfruits**  
    of those who have fallen asleep.

22. For as in **Adam** all die,  
    even so in **Christ**  
    all shall be made alive.

23. But each in his own order:  
    Christ the firstfruits,  
    afterward those who are Christ’s  
    at His coming.

24. Then comes the **end**,  
    when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father,  
    having abolished all rule, authority, and power.

26. The last enemy that will be destroyed  
    is **death**.

## **The Logic of Resurrection: Seeds and Bodies**

35. But someone will say,  
    “How are the dead raised?  
    And with what body do they come?”

36. Foolish one —  
    what you sow does not come to life  
    unless it **dies**.

37. And what you sow  
    is not the **body that shall be**,  
    but bare seed —  
    perhaps wheat or something else.

38. But God gives it a **body as He chooses**,  
    and to each kind of seed its **own body**.

40. There are **celestial bodies**  
    and **terrestrial bodies**…

42. So also is the resurrection of the dead:  
    It is sown in **corruption**,  
    raised in **incorruption**.  

43. Sown in **dishonor**;  
    raised in **glory**.  

44. Sown a **natural body**;  
    raised a **spiritual body**.

There is a natural body,  
and there is a spiritual body.

## **The Two Adams**

45. The first man **Adam**  
    became a **living soul**.  

    The last Adam  
    became a **life-giving Spirit**.

47. The first man  
    was from the **earth**,  
    made of dust.  

    The second Man  
    is from **heaven**.

49. As we have borne the image  
    of the man of dust,  
    we shall also bear the image  
    of the **heavenly Man**.

---

## **The Final Transformation**

50. Flesh and blood  
    cannot inherit the kingdom of God;  
    nor does corruption  
    inherit incorruption.

51. Behold, I tell you a **mystery**:  
    We shall not all sleep,  
    but we shall all be **changed** —

52. In a moment,  
    in the **twinkling of an eye**,  
    at the **last trumpet**.

For the trumpet will sound,  
the dead will be raised incorruptible,  
and we shall be changed.

54. Then shall be brought to pass the saying:  
    “Death is swallowed up in victory.”

55. “O death, where is thy sting?  
     O grave, where is thy victory?”

57. But thanks be to God,  
    who gives us the **victory**  
    through our Lord Jesus Christ.

58. Therefore, my beloved,  
    be steadfast, immovable,  
    always abounding in the work of the Lord,  
    knowing your labor is **not in vain**.

# **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**  
### *Poetic Alignment*

- The seed must fall  
  before the tree can rise.

- The body you sow  
  is not the body you reap.

- The first Adam is dust.  
  The last Adam is breath.

- The resurrection  
  is not escape —  
  it is transformation.

- Death is not the wall.  
  It is the doorway.

- Corruptible becomes incorruptible.  
  Weakness becomes strength.  
  The natural yields to the spiritual.

- Victory is not delay —  
  it is unveiling.

# **Summary / Commentary**

### **1. Resurrection is the center of the faith.**  
Without it —  
preaching collapses,  
faith collapses,  
and the entire gospel collapses.

### **2. Resurrection is transformation, not resuscitation.**  
Paul’s seed analogy destroys the idea  
that resurrection is simply “getting your same body back.”

The **seed-body**  
and the **resurrection-body**  
are related —  
but not identical.

### **3. The two Adams explain our two identities.**

- **Adam:** dust → weakness → death  
- **Christ:** Spirit → glory → life

We bear the image of Adam now.  
We will bear the image of Christ then.

### **4. The victory over death is not metaphor — it is promise.**  
Death is “the last enemy” because it is the final boundary.  
Resurrection is the final removal of that boundary.

### **5. The chapter ends with a command, not a theory.**

> “Be steadfast… your labor is not in vain.”

If resurrection is true,  
everything matters.
