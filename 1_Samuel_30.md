### *Strength Renewed and All Recovered*

> _“But David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.”_  
> — **1 Samuel 30 : 6 KJV**

---

## **BKV-NR — Narrative Reading**

### **I. The Burning of Ziklag (vv 1–6)**  

When David and his men came to **Ziklag (The Pressed Place)**,  
they found it burned with fire, and their wives and children taken captive by the **Amalekites (Devouring Emotions)**.  

David and his men lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep.  
His own people spoke of stoning him, for their grief was bitter.  
But David **encouraged himself in the Source his God.**

*When all outward strength is lost, the inner strength of divine reliance begins.*

---

### **II. The Inquiry of Renewal (vv 7–10)**  

David said to **Abiathar (Father of Abundance)** the priest,  
> “Bring me the ephod.”  

And David enquired of the Source, saying,  
> “Shall I pursue after this troop? Shall I overtake them?”  

The Source answered,  
> “Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail recover all.”  

David went, he and the six hundred men.  
But two hundred stayed behind, faint and unable to continue.

*The true leader seeks divine direction before reaction.  
Encouragement becomes inquiry, and inquiry becomes victory.*

---

### **III. The Egyptian Servant (vv 11–15)**  

They found an **Egyptian (Memory of Bondage)** in the field, half-dead, whom they fed and revived.  
He had been servant to an Amalekite.  
He said,  
> “My master left me three days ago when I fell sick.”  

He guided David to the camp of the Amalekites.

*Even remnants of the lower self, when revived by kindness,  
become instruments of divine recovery.*

---

### **IV. The Recovery of All (vv 16–20)**  

They found the Amalekites feasting over the spoil.  
David smote them from twilight even unto the next evening.  
He recovered all that was taken—wives, children, goods, and flocks.  

David took the spoil and called it **David’s Share**, saying,  
> “This is that which the Source hath given us.”

*What is recovered through faith must be shared;  
the victory of love is never for self alone.*

---

### **V. The Law of Distribution (vv 21–31)**  

When they came to the two hundred who had stayed behind,  
some of the men said,  
> “They shall not share in the spoil, for they went not with us.”  

But David said,  
> “Ye shall not do so: for as his part is that goeth down to battle,  
> so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff; they shall part alike.”  

He sent portions to all the cities of Judah.  

*The law of restoration is generosity;  
the blessing that is truly divine includes even those who could not follow.*

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Samuel 30** unveils the **Law of Restoration** —  
the return of all things through renewed strength in God.

- **Ziklag** is the press of affliction — where all is lost before all is restored.  
- **Amalekites** are destructive emotions and scattered energies.  
- **Egyptian Servant** represents memory redeemed by compassion.  
- **Two Hundred Resting Men** signify the faculties that cannot act but still belong to the whole.  
- **David’s Strength** is divine courage reborn from silence and surrender.  

Restoration begins where self-reliance ends.

## **Addendum — The Law of Restoration**

The soul that strengthens itself in God  
recovers even what seemed lost beyond recall.  
Loss teaches dependence; dependence unlocks renewal.  
Restoration is never partial;  
what was burned returns purified.

## **BKV-DR — Devotional Reading**
### *Encouraged in the Source*

---

30 : 1–6  
I returned to the place of my dwelling,  
and it was burned with fire.  
Everything dear to me was gone.  
My heart collapsed beneath the weight of loss,  
and even my friends turned their eyes against me.  
Then I remembered the Source.  
I bowed within and found a strength that was not my own.  

---

30 : 7–10  
I asked, “Shall I pursue?”  
and the still small voice said, “Pursue, for you shall recover all.”  
So I rose from ashes and followed the faint trail of faith.  
Some could not go on; I left them in peace.  
Grace will share with them later.

---

30 : 11–15  
On the path I found a broken man.  
I fed him bread and water,  
and he became my guide.  
Even weakness, when shown mercy,  
points the way to victory.  

---

30 : 16–20  
The enemy feasted on what was mine.  
But I came upon them at twilight,  
and truth reclaimed what love had lost.  
Nothing was missing.  
Even the fire had purified the spoil.  
All I recovered became praise.  

---

30 : 21–31  
When some said, “They shall not share,”  
I answered, “They are ours also.”  
The blessing of God divides not by strength but by belonging.  
What is restored is meant for all.  
I sent gifts throughout the land,  
for restoration is generous and peace unites the whole.

---

### **Meditative Reflection**

> Fire may take, but faith restores.  
> Despair may break, but trust rebuilds.  
> The soul that strengthens itself in God  
> finds nothing truly lost—only waiting to be redeemed.
