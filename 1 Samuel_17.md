The BKV Translation of 1 Samuel 17  

17:1-3  
Now the worldly forces gathered their thoughts for a great inner battle.  
The egoic will and the spiritual consciousness were encamped on opposing mental planes, with a chasm of despair between them.  
17:4-7  
And a champion of materialism came forth from the ego's camp, a great negative thought force named Goliath, which signifies the prideful, arrogant, and oppressive aspects of the self.  
This great misconception was armored with the defensive illusions of the intellect and carried a spear that represented the sharp, piercing cruelty of the lower mind.  
17:8-11  
This materialist thought stood and taunted the spiritual consciousness, saying, “Why have you come out to set yourself against me? Am I not a force of the ego, and are you not merely servants of the personal will?”  
It demanded a single-minded focus on its terms, and when the personal will and all its thoughts heard this, they were dismayed and greatly afraid, for they were powerless against this manifestation of error.  
17:12-16  
Now, the beloved inner principle of divine love was the youngest faculty of the eternal "I AM."  
While the older, more established thoughts followed the personal will, this principle of love was tending to the natural forces of the soul, living in a consciousness of abundant substance.  
The oppressive thought of the ego manifested morning and evening for forty days, a period of testing and trial for the soul.  
17:20-24  
And the principle of divine love came to the forefront of consciousness at the moment of inner distress. It found the inner faculties in disarray and full of fear, for they were retreating from the manifestation of error.  
17:25-30  
Divine love was appalled that an unredeemed thought could so brazenly defy the armies of the Living Source. It was not a battle against an external force, but against the inner giant that had taken hold of the human imagination and self-perception, a great negative thought.  
17:31-37  
The principle of divine love was brought before the personal will, who told it that it was too young to fight such a mighty force.  
But divine love answered that it had mastered the wild, animal-like thoughts of its lower nature (the lion and the bear) and knew that this battle was an inner one, for the power to defeat this giant was not in the self but in the Living Source.  
17:38-39  
The personal will offered its own armor and sword to the divine love principle.  
This represents the mind's attempt to use its old, human-driven methods—logic, reason, or willpower—to fight a spiritual battle.  
The armor did not fit, symbolizing that one cannot win a spiritual battle with the ego's tools. Divine love rejected them.  
17:40-42  
And so, the principle of divine love took its staff—the symbol of its spiritual authority—and chose five smooth stones from the stream, which represents the rock of faith and grace.  
The sling symbolizes the power of focused thought and word, the projectile force of a Truth affirmation.  
17:45-47  
Divine love declared to the egoic thought, “You come to me with a sword and a spear, but I come to you in the name of the Lord of the armies of truth and righteousness, whom you have defied! This day, the Lord will deliver you into my hands, and I will strike you down and remove your head from you.”   This is the recognition that the battle belongs to the spiritual principle, and the victory is of the Divine.  
17:48-51  
And divine love ran swiftly toward the great negative thought. It took one stone—a single, clear, powerful Truth—from its bag and slung it with assurance.  
The stone struck the great misconception in the forehead, the seat of the imagination and false human vision, and it sank into it.  
The giant thought fell to the ground, and divine love then used the giant's own sword to sever its head, symbolizing that error carries within it the seed of its own destruction.  
17:52-58  
When the false, materialized thoughts saw their champion slain, they fled, and the righteous forces of the soul rose up and pursued them.  
The head of the slain giant was taken to the inner city of Jerusalem, signifying that the defeated egoic thoughts were brought into the consciousness of peace.
