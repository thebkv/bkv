# PSR Monologue — James: The Last Steward

*“From outer stewardship to inner.”*

---

Today I want to talk about James.

Not James as a political football, a meme, or a slogan attached to a leather-bound book.  
I want to talk about James as a **steward**.

I don’t think most people realize the gravity of the moment he was standing in.  
He wasn’t just a king; he was a **load-bearing structure** in the architecture of the West.

---

I’ll start here: I like the King James Bible.

I know there are paraphrased versions that people love. They’re accessible, warm, and explanatory. And I understand why—they can be genuinely helpful.

But what I love about the KJV is precisely what makes it difficult: it is **non-compressible**.

It keeps the overloaded terms.  
It keeps the names heavy.  
It doesn’t rush to resolve the tension of the text.

It stays close enough to the original languages that the text retains its **systemic gravity**.

This matters, because Scripture isn’t just information—it is **structure**.  
And James understood that if you simplify the structure to make it “user-friendly,” you eventually make it irrelevant.

---

And just to be clear—I’m not anti-paraphrase.

Paraphrased editions can be genuinely helpful.  
They’re like someone walking alongside you saying, *“Here’s what this means.”*

But sometimes that help comes at a cost.

Take a verse like this from John:

> *“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.”*

That sentence is dense on purpose.

When a paraphrase smooths that out—when it explains it instead of presenting it—you lose something important. You lose the tension. You lose the weight. You lose the space where the reader has to stop and reckon with what’s being said.

The KJV leaves that work with you.

And I think James understood that Scripture isn’t supposed to do all the work *for* you.  
It’s supposed to work **on** you.

---

That didn’t happen by accident.

James didn’t do this because he wanted a “brand.”  
He did it because he understood that his role was not to speak *for* the Word, but to **carry it through a high-pressure transition in human consciousness**.

James lived at a **hinge**.

Behind him was what you might call a *monolithic era*: institutional control, where meaning was locked in a cage of Latin and managed by power.

Ahead of him was what feels like an *atomic era*: fragmentation, ideology, and the risk of Scripture being pulled apart by a thousand individual opinions.

James was the **high-pressure valve** between these two worlds.

He didn’t try to stop the fragmentation.  
He knew the words: *“The kingdom is within.”*

Instead, he built a specialized crate so the bird could survive the flight—from the cage of the Church to its new home in the individual heart.

---

James is often called a “philosopher king.” That’s fair—but not because he was abstract.

It’s because he thought **structurally**.

He knew the dangers of his position:

- If he imposed doctrine, the Word would fracture.  
- If he simplified meaning, the Word would flatten.  
- If he claimed personal authority over the text, the Word would be politicized.

So he practiced a rare, high-level **restraint**.

He stepped back so the Text could step forward.

That restraint is the signal of a true steward.

---

And James did not do this in a vacuum.

He surrounded himself with custodians, not firebrands.

People like George Keith, the Earl Marischal.

Keith wasn’t loud or theatrical; he was trusted.  
He founded Marischal College not as a vanity project, but as a kind of **stewardship laboratory**.

They weren’t just teaching *what* to think.  
They were training people in **how to hold weight**—how to maintain ordered learning in a world that was about to lose its mind.

---

In the background of all this, you have Shakespeare.

While James was building the external vessel for the text, Shakespeare was mapping the **internal fracture** of the human condition.

He wrote of kings who couldn’t hold their identity.  
Of authority that performed instead of restrained.

This was the air they were all breathing.

It wasn’t the romanticized Renaissance we see in movies.  
It was volatile. Transitional. Structurally unstable.

James was the last one standing in the doorway—holding the ceiling up until the inheritance could be moved.

---

Now, the hard question: was James “saved”?

I’m not interested in turning that into a theological debate.

I’d rather ask a quieter question:  
Did he show the signs of alignment?

Did he show humility?  
Did he show the willingness to let his own *old man* be checked by a higher order?

I think the answer is yes.

Pride doesn’t limit itself the way James did.

A proud man would have inserted his own commentary into the margins.  
A proud man would have demanded interpretive loyalty to the Crown.

James didn’t.

He became a **servant to the continuity of the message**.

---

And he was resented for it.

Resented by theologians who wanted control.  
Resented by factions who saw him as a ruffian from *beyond the Wall*—an outsider.

That resentment matters, because it tells you something important.

It tells you he wasn’t serving a party.

He was serving the **structure**.

---

James is the last person for whom this kind of public, almost “Roman” stewardship was possible.

He was the last king to try to hold **Rome**—universal law—and **Judea**—particular spirit—together in one bound volume.

After him, Rome went to the politicians.  
Judea went to the person in the pew.

And the Kingdom finally moved inward.

James didn’t complete that process.

But he was the shepherd who kept the Voice from being lost during the divorce.

He held the gap.

---

That’s why I don’t treat the KJV like a fetish.  
And I don’t treat James like a saint.

I treat him like a **load-bearing figure**.

We live after the fracture.

We don’t get philosopher kings anymore.  
What we get is **responsibility inside persons**.

And because of that one moment in the seventeenth century, Scripture is still capable of functioning as a **mirror** instead of a weapon.

That’s not nostalgia.

That’s gratitude.

---

James wasn’t the voice of Scripture.  
He was the steward who kept the Voice from being drowned out.

And once the crate was delivered, his role was over.

From outer stewardship…  
to inner.
