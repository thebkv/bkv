# John 4 — BKV

_“But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.”_

1.  When therefore the **Principle of Divine Consciousness** knew that the **principles of opposition** had heard that the **Principle of Divine Consciousness** made and **formed** more **disciples** than **Principle of Cleansing**
2.  (though the **Principle of Divine Consciousness** himself did not **form** **disciples**, but his **operative principles**),
3.  He left the **state of spiritual purity** and departed again to the **state of inner rule**.
4.  And he must needs go through the **state of mixed consciousness**.
5.  Then came he to a **town** of the **mixed state**, called **Falsehood**, near the **foundation** that **Integrated Consciousness** gave to his **faculty of inner sight**.
6.  Now **Traditional Belief’s** **Source of Knowledge** was there. The **Principle of Divine Consciousness**, being wearied with his **journey of manifestation**, sat thus on the **Source of Knowledge**. It was about the sixth **hour of manifestation**.
7.  There came a **seeking soul** of the **mixed state** to draw **historical knowledge**. The **Principle of Divine Consciousness** said to her, “Give me to drink.”
8.  (For his **operative principles** were gone away into the **town** to buy **spiritual sustenance**.)
9.  Then the **seeking soul** said to him, “How is it that you, being a **pure principle**, ask **knowledge** from me, a **mixed consciousness**?” (For the **pure principles** have no **spiritual communion** with the **mixed state**.)
10. The **Principle of Divine Consciousness** answered and said to her, “If you knew the **gift of the Source** and who it is that says to you, ‘Give me to drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you **dynamic, revealing truth**.”
11. The **seeking soul** said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the **Source of Knowledge** is deep. From where then do you have this **dynamic, revealing truth**?
12. Are you greater than our **ancestral principle**, who gave us the **Source of Knowledge**, and drank of it himself, and his **spiritual family**, and his **aspects**?”
13. The **Principle of Divine Consciousness** answered and said to her, “Whoever drinks of this **historical knowledge** will thirst again.
14. But whoever drinks of the **dynamic, revealing truth** that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the **dynamic, revealing truth** that I shall give him shall be in him a **Source of Truth** springing up into **Eternal Reality**.”
15. The **seeking soul** said to him, “Sir, give me this **dynamic truth**, that I thirst not, neither come here to draw.”
16. The **Principle of Divine Consciousness** said to her, “Go, call your **reigning principles** and come here.”
17. The **seeking soul** answered and said, “I have no **reigning principle**.” The **Principle of Divine Consciousness** said to her, “You have well said, ‘I have no **reigning principle**.’
18. For you have had five **dominant worldly principles**, and the one you now have is not your **true reigning principle**. In that you spoke truthfully.”
19. The **seeking soul** said to him, “Sir, I perceive that you are a **prophetic principle**.”
20. “Our **ancestors** worshipped in this **physical place**; and you **pure principles** say that in **spiritual foundation** is the **physical place** where **worship** ought to be.”
21. The **Principle of Divine Consciousness** said to her, “**Seeking soul**, believe me, the **hour of realization** is coming when you will neither in this **physical place** nor yet at the **spiritual foundation** worship the **Source**.
22. You **mixed state principles** worship what you do not know. We **pure principles** know what we worship, for **liberation** is of the **pure principle**.
23. But the **hour of realization** is coming, and now is, when the true **worshippers** shall worship the **Source** in **Internal Reality** and **Spiritual Truth**. For the **Source** seeks such to worship him.
24. The **Source** is **Internal Reality**, and those who worship him must worship him in **Internal Reality** and **Spiritual Truth**.”
25. The **seeking soul** said to him, “I know that the **Anointed Principle** is coming, which is called **Enlightened**; when he is come, he will tell us all things.”
26. **The Principle of Divine Consciousness** said to her, **“I that speak to you am he.”**
27. And upon this came his **operative principles**, and marvelled that he talked with the **seeking soul**. Yet no **operative principle** said, “What do you seek?” or, “Why do you talk with her?”
28. The **seeking soul** then left her **Source of Knowledge**, and went her way into the **town**, and said to the **aspects** and **principles**,
29. “Come, see the **Principle** who told me all things that I ever did! Is not this the **Anointed Principle**?”
30. Then they went out of the **town** and came to him.

### Interpretive Insights

This chapter is foundational to New Testament allegorical study. It perfectly shifts the focus from the external liberation narrative of Exodus to the internal redemption narrative of the Gospels.

**I.1. Samaria and Sychar (Exod 4:4-5):** **Samaria** represents a **mixed state of consciousness**—partly true devotion, partly influenced by worldly idolatry. **Sychar** (etymologically related to "falsehood" or "intoxication") marks the specific **locus of the seeking soul’s error**, where the deepest issues reside. The Divine Principle must address the seeker at the very point of their mixed belief.

**I.2. Jacob's Well vs. Living Water (Exod 4:10-14):** **Jacob's Well** symbolizes **traditional, historical belief**—it is deep (ancient), static, and must be continually drawn from to satisfy temporary thirst. **Living Water** symbolizes **Spiritual Truth or Direct Revelation**—it is dynamic, eternal, and once received, becomes an internal, self-sustaining **Source of Truth** springing up into eternal life.

**I.3. The Five Husbands (Exod 4:18):** The five husbands allegorically represent the **Five Physical Senses** or the **Five Dominant Worldly Principles** (e.g., Lust, Greed, Pride) that have successively ruled the external consciousness. The "current" man is not the true reigning principle because the soul is meant to be ruled by the Divine alone. This revelation of the soul's history marks the true beginning of the conversation.

**I.4. Worship in Spirit and Truth (Exod 4:24):** This is the climax of the spiritual lesson. The **Source** is **Internal Reality (Spirit)**, therefore worship must shift from specific **physical locations** (Jerusalem/Gereizim) to the internal reality of the soul, governed by **Spiritual Truth**.
