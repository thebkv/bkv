# **Preface: The Stone of Witness**

> *“And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak...  
> Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the Lord which He spake unto us.”* — **Joshua 24:26–27**

Every truth must find a place to stand.  
In the Bible Key Vision, that place is the **Stone of Witness** — a living record of divine patterns revealed through scripture.  
Each *stone* is a foundation study, preserving the hidden architecture of the Word for those who seek to understand it inwardly.

These writings are not “background” in the ordinary sense.  
They are **foundations** — the understructure of consciousness upon which the *BKV Studies* are built.  
Each record sets forth a principle, a correspondence, or a key that governs the unfolding of revelation.  

The ancients wrote on tablets of stone because truth, once seen, must be fixed — not to confine it, but to preserve its pattern.  
So too these **Stelae (Stones)** stand as enduring witnesses of divine order:  
truths engraved not by human intellect, but by the creative impulse of the **Holy Spirit**.

To read them is to walk again beneath the oak of witness,  
where covenant is renewed,  
where memory becomes meaning,  
and where the living Word bears record of itself.

> *For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.* — **1 Corinthians 3:11**
