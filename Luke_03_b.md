# Luke 3

### **BKV (Bible Key Version)**

1. Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of the **ruling egoic force**, with the **intellectual mind** in governance of the state of **religious tradition**, and the **emotional self** being in command of a state of **lower-level understanding**, and his brother, the principle of a divided and carnal self, in charge of separate regions of consciousness, and the **inner sense of emptiness** being the ruler of yet another state,
2. With the **religious thought forces** being the high priests, the **Word of the Absolute Source** came to the **purifying principle**, the son of **Memory of God**, in the **wilderness**.
3. And it went into all the inner being of the mind, preaching the **immersion** of a **change of mind** for the **healing of separation**;
4. As it is written in the book of the words of the **prophetic principle**, saying, "The voice of a single, urgent thought in the **wilderness**, prepare the way for the **Divine Principle**, make its paths **right**."
5. "Every low state of consciousness shall be filled, and every high point of **ego** and pride shall be brought low; and the **crooked thoughts** shall be made **straight**, and the **rough ways** of old habits shall be made **smooth**;"
6. "And all of the **consciousness of humanity** shall perceive the **salvation** of the **Absolute Source**."
7. Then the **purifying principle** said to the multitude of thoughts that came forth to be immersed by it, "O you **generation of vipers**, who has warned you to flee from the **inevitable consequences** to come?"
8. "Bring forth therefore **actions** that are worthy of a **change of mind**, and do not begin to say within yourselves, 'We have an old, externalized belief system as our origin:' for I say unto you, that the **Absolute Source** is able from these hard, rigid thoughts to raise up new spiritual principles to form a new belief system."
9. "And now also the **axe** of fundamental change is laid unto the root of the **trees** of old, established beliefs: every established belief therefore which brings not forth good **actions** is cut down, and cast into the fire of transformation."
10. And the inner faculties asked it, saying, "What shall we do then?"
11. The **purifying principle** answers and says to them, "The faculty that has two spiritual coverings, let it impart to the faculty that has none; and the faculty that has abundant sustenance, let it do likewise."
12. Then came also faculties of **outer focus** to be immersed, and said to it, "Teacher, what shall we do?"
13. And the **purifying principle** said to them, "Do not take more than that which is appointed for your own needs."
14. And the faculties of **inner conflict** likewise asked it, saying, "And what shall we do?" And it said to them, "Do no harm to any inner faculty, nor accuse any falsely; and be content with the value of your inner work."
15. And as the inner faculties were in a state of expectation, and all thoughts mused in their **hearts** of the **purifying principle**, whether it were the **Anointed One**, or not;
16. The **purifying principle** answered, saying to them all, "I indeed immerse you with the **water of outer cleansing**; but one mightier than I comes, the spiritual principle whose lower nature I am not worthy to unloose: he shall immerse you with the **Divine Vitality** and with **purifying fire**:"
17. "Whose **winnowing fan** is in his hand, and he will thoroughly separate the **truth** from the **falsity** on his **inner threshing floor**; and he will gather the **good** into his **inner storehouse**; but the **falsity** he will burn with **unquenchable fire**."
18. And many other things in its exhortation the **purifying principle** spoke to the inner faculties.
19. But the **emotional self**, being reproved by it for its self-indulgent thoughts, and for all the evils which the **emotional self** had done,
20. Added yet this above all, that it silenced the **purifying principle** and put it in a state of imprisonment.
21. Now when all the inner faculties were immersed, it came to pass, that the **Divine Self** also being immersed, and in a state of **inner prayer**, the **expansive state of consciousness** was opened,
22. And the **Divine Vitality** descended in a perceivable form like a dove upon him, and a voice came from the **expansive state of consciousness**, which said, "You are my beloved **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**; in you I am well pleased."
23. And the **Divine Self** himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of **Inner Integrity**, which was the son of a **principle of elevation**,
24. Which was the son of a **principle of divine gift**, which was the son of a **principle of union**, which was the son of a **principle of kingship**, which was the son of a **principle of grace**, which was the son of a **principle of wholeness**,
25. Which was the son of a **principle of divine gift**, which was the son of a **principle of peace**, which was the son of a **principle of comfort**, which was the son of a **principle of firmness**, which was the son of a **principle of victory**,

## **Interpretive Summary**

Luke 3 presents a powerful shift in the inner journey, moving from the preparatory phase of purification to the direct manifestation of the Divine Self. The chapter opens by grounding the narrative in the familiar, external world of political and religious authorities. In the BKV, these figures—Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate, Herod, Annas, and Caiaphas—are not just historical figures but archetypes of inner rule: the ruling egoic force, the compromising intellectual mind, the irrational emotional self, and the rigid, traditional religious thought forces. These are the various parts of our consciousness that hold power before the Divine Principle takes full dominion.

John the Baptist, the purifying principle, operates in the wilderness, a state of inner desolation, calling all inner faculties to a change of mind and to the healing of separation. His message is one of leveling the inner landscape; filling the valleys of despair and bringing low the mountains of pride. He challenges the self-righteousness of old beliefs (the "children of Abraham"), declaring that true spiritual birth can come from even the most rigid and unyielding thoughts ("stones"). His warnings and instructions to the various groups—the crowds, the faculties of outer focus, and the faculties of inner conflict—show that purification is a practical process that must transform every part of the self.

The central event is the immersion of the Divine Self (Jesus) by the purifying principle (John). This symbolizes the True Consciousness humbling itself to the process of purification before its full power is revealed. The descent of the Divine Vitality as a dove and the voice from the expansive state of consciousness ("You are my beloved Consciousness-of-the-Divine...") represent the anointing and affirmation of this new state of being from the Absolute Source itself. This is the moment of spiritual union when the Divine Self is fully recognized and empowered within the inner being.

The chapter concludes with the genealogy, a profound map of the lineage of human consciousness. It traces the journey from the first "man" (Adam) back to the Absolute Source (God), and forward through a series of archetypal principles to the manifestation of the Divine Salvation. This genealogy is a spiritual biography of humanity, illustrating that the potential for the Divine Self lies within the very fabric of our being, a latent truth passed down through every facet of the soul's development.
