#Matthew06

## Chapter 6 Key Notes
- **Righteousness → Alignment with God’s Will** — contrasted with outward display (*Matthew 6:1*).  
- **Hypocrites** — Literally “actors, mask-wearers”; those seeking human praise rather than God’s approval.  
- **Father in secret** — God as the one who sees the hidden heart (*1 Samuel 16:7*).  
- **Prayer** — Direct communion with God, not performance.  
- **The Lord’s Prayer** — Model of dependence, reverence, daily provision, forgiveness, deliverance.  
- **Forgive** — Release of debt (*Matthew 6:12, 14–15*).  
- **Treasures** — Symbol of values or inner store; earthly vs heavenly.  
- **Eye as lamp** — The inner focus that fills the whole person with light or darkness.  
- **Two Masters** — Impossible to serve both God and Mammon (wealth, personified).  
- **Birds / Lilies** — Creation as witness to God’s provision.  
- **Seek first the Reign of God** — Priority of alignment with divine will over anxiety.

## Matthew 6 (BKV Symbolic-Only Restatement)

1. Beware of practicing your **Alignment with God’s Will** to be seen by others, for then you have no reward from your Father in heaven.  

2. When you give to the needy, do not sound a trumpet as the **Mask-Wearers** do, that they may be praised by others. Truly, they have their reward.  

3. But when you give, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,  

4. so that your giving may be in secret. And your **Father in Secret** who sees will reward you.  

5. And when you pray, do not be like the **Mask-Wearers**, for they love to stand in synagogues and on street corners to be seen. Truly, they have their reward.  

6. But when you pray, go into your room, shut the door, and pray to your **Father in Secret**; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.  

7. And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the nations do, for they think they will be heard for many words.  

8. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask.  

9. Pray then like this:  
“Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.  

10. Your **Reign** come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.  

11. Give us this day our daily bread.  

12. Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.  

13. Lead us not into testing, but deliver us from the evil one.”  

14. For if you forgive others, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.  

15. But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father forgive your debts.  

16. When you fast, do not look gloomy like the **Mask-Wearers**, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting. Truly, they have their reward.  

17. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,  

18. so that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your **Father in Secret**; and your Father who sees will reward you.  

19. Do not lay up for yourselves **Treasures on Earth**, where moth and rust destroy, and thieves break in and steal.  

20. Lay up **Treasures in Heaven**, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and thieves do not break in and steal.  

21. For where your **Treasure** is, there your heart will be also.  

22. The **Eye** is the lamp of the body. If your **Eye** is clear, your whole body will be full of **Light**.  

23. But if your **Eye** is dark, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!  

24. No one can serve two masters. You cannot serve both God and **Mammon**.  

25. Therefore I say to you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?  

26. Look at the **Birds of the Air**: they do not sow or reap or gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?  

27. Which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?  

28. And why be anxious about clothing? Consider the **Lilies of the Field**, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin,  

29. yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.  

30. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?  

31. Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat? What shall we drink? What shall we wear?’  

32. For the nations seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows you need them all.  

33. But seek first the **Reign of God** and his **Righteousness**, and all these things will be added to you.  

34. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
