## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

### **I. The Man of Image (vv 1–2)**  

There was a man of **Benjamin (Son of the Right Hand)** named **Kish (Snare)**, a mighty man of power.  
He had a son whose name was **Saul (Asked For)** — a choice young man and goodly: there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he; from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.  

*The outer will appears noble and commanding; the projection of divine strength into human form seems ideal.*  
*But height without inward hearing becomes pride in appearance.*

### **II. The Lost Asses (vv 3–10)**  

The **asses (beasts of service)** of Kish were lost.  
Kish said to Saul, “Take one of the servants and arise, go seek the asses.”  

They passed through the hill country but found them not.  
When they came to the land of **Zuph (Overflowing Counsel)**, Saul said,  
> “Come, let us return, lest my father cease caring for the asses and take thought for us.”  

The servant said, “Behold, there is in this city a man of God; peradventure he can show us our way.”  

*The search for lost means of service leads to the prophet — the moment when practicality, exhausted, turns toward revelation.*

### **III. The Meeting with Samuel (vv 11–21)**  

As they went up to the city, they met maidens going to draw water.  
They said, “Is the seer here?”  
They answered, “Behold, he is before you; make haste, for he came today to bless the sacrifice.”  

When Samuel saw Saul, the Source said unto him,  
> “Behold the man whom I spake to thee of; this same shall reign over my people.”  

Samuel took Saul to the high place and set him above all the guests, giving him the chief portion.  
*Destiny overtakes the seeker even while he looks for lesser things.*  

Saul said, “Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest tribe?”  
*Outer humility often masks inner ambition; the self-image alternates between unworthiness and desire for recognition.*

### **IV. The Revelation of Kingship (vv 22–27)**  

Samuel spoke privately with Saul and said,  
> “On whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee?”  

Then he anointed Saul, saying,  
> “Stand still awhile, that I may show thee the word of God.”  

*Thus begins the reign of the Outer King — the exaltation of form.  The human self is crowned, not yet in rebellion but in ignorance.*

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Samuel 9** portrays the first act in the drama of **Outer Rule** — the enthronement of the human will.  

- **Saul (Asked For)** = the externalized desire of the people; the ego given crown and scepter.  
- **Kish (Snare)** = the natural, possessive self from which this will arises.  
- **Asses (Beasts of Service)** = faculties of practical action, lost through distraction and pride.  
- **The Search** = the restless wandering of the mind looking for purpose in external fields.  
- **The Prophet** = spiritual intuition waiting to interpret lost labor into destiny.  

The story shows that even misguided seeking can lead to encounter with truth; yet when the will is exalted without transformation, the crown becomes a weight.

## **Addendum — The Law of Misguided Search**

The search for what is lost in the outer world leads ultimately to the inner Seer.  
The Spirit meets the seeking will where it wanders and transforms the quest into a call.  
Yet when the will becomes the object of desire, the anointing itself becomes a test.

## **Core BKV Principle — 1 Samuel 9**

> **Every search for lost purpose leads eventually to the Prophet within.  
> But when the will that was meant to serve is crowned to rule, the shadow of pride begins to form.**
