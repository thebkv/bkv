# 1 Samuel 31 — The Principle of Completion

> — **1 Samuel 31 : 6 KJV**

## **BKV-NR — Narrative Reading**

### **I. The Battle on Mount Gilboa (vv 1–3)**  

The **Philistines (Material Powers)** fought against Israel.  
The men of Israel fled, and many fell slain on **Mount Gilboa (Hill of Flowing Waters Stopped)**.  
The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons,  
and the archers wounded him sorely.  

*When material forces gain the upper hand,  
the outer will stands exposed and powerless.*

---

### **II. The Self-Inflicted End (vv 4–6)**  

Saul said to his armourbearer,  
> “Draw thy sword and thrust me through,  
> lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me.”  

But his armourbearer would not; therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.  
When his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell upon his sword and died with him.  

*The egoic will, unable to surrender, destroys itself.  
What refuses transformation must yield through dissolution.*

---

### **III. The Collapse of the Old Order (vv 7–10)**  

When the men of Israel saw that Saul and his sons were dead,  
they fled the cities, and the Philistines dwelt in them.  
They cut off Saul’s head and stripped his armour,  
and fastened his body to the wall of **Beth-shan (House of Ease).**

*The outer order of life — when ruled by the will alone —  
is claimed by the world to which it belonged.*

---

### **IV. The Valor of Jabesh-Gilead (vv 11–13)**  

The men of **Jabesh-Gilead (Healing Stream)** heard what the Philistines had done.  
They arose by night, took down Saul’s body from the wall,  
and buried him beneath a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.  

*Even in the fall of the ego, compassion acts.  
The redeemed faculties honor what once served the divine purpose.*

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Samuel 31** completes the book with the **Law of Completion** —  
the necessary end of the old regime before new consciousness can reign.

- **Saul** is the Outer Will, exhausted by self-rule.  
- **His Sons** are the extensions of personal power and ambition.  
- **The Armourbearer** represents dependent strength — self-support falling with self-will.  
- **Mount Gilboa** signifies the drying up of inspiration when will separates from Spirit.  
- **Jabesh-Gilead** is mercy that remains even toward what must pass away.  

The kingdom of the ego falls not through divine wrath but natural exhaustion.  
The next dawn will belong to David — love enthroned.

## **Addendum — The Law of Completion**

Every cycle ends before the next begins.  
The will that once served must die to make room for love’s reign.  
Death in Scripture is transformation in disguise.  
When the outer yields, the inner awakens.

## **BKV-DR — Devotional Reading**
### *The End and the Beginning*

---

31 : 1–3  
The battle rose upon the hill,  
and I saw the flow of strength run dry.  
The arrows of fear found me;  
my defenses turned to dust.  
The power that once carried me  
now trembled beneath its own weight.

---

31 : 4–6  
I said within, “End it quickly,  
lest I fall into the hands of the world.”  
But no one would strike—  
so I fell upon the sword of my own making.  
The will perished by the weapon it trusted,  
and silence covered the field.

---

31 : 7–10  
The old order fled.  
The world claimed what was left,  
and hung my armor on its walls.  
So passes the glory of self-reliance—  
from throne to trophy.

---

31 : 11–13  
But mercy came at night.  
Gentle hands took down what pride had raised,  
and buried me beneath the healing tree.  
Even in death, compassion lingered.  
The wind whispered of a coming dawn.  

---

### **Meditative Reflection**

> When self-rule ends, peace begins.  
> What falls by pride rises again in love.  
> The sword that once defended becomes the plowshare of a new day.  
> The kingdom passes inward—  
> and the heart takes the crown.
