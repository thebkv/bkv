# 1 Corinthians 14 — BKV Study  
### *The Gifts and the Goal: Love as the Guide for Spiritual Expression*

---

# **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

1. Pursue **love**,  
   and earnestly desire the **spiritual gifts**,  
   but especially that you may **prophesy**.

2. For the one who speaks in a **tongue**  
   speaks not to men but to God;  
   no one understands him,  
   for in the spirit he speaks **mysteries**.

3. But the one who **prophesies**  
   speaks to men for **edification**,  
   **encouragement**,  
   and **comfort**.

4. The one who speaks in a tongue  
   **builds himself up**;  
   but the one who prophesies  
   **builds up the assembly**.

5. I desire that you all speak with tongues,  
   but even more that you prophesy;  
   for greater is he who prophesies  
   than he who speaks with tongues,  
   unless he interprets,  
   so the assembly may receive **edification**.

# **Clarity Over Ecstasy**

6. If I come to you speaking in tongues —  
   what will I profit you  
   unless I speak to you 
   by **revelation**,  
   or **knowledge**,  
   or **prophecy**,  
   or **instruction**?

7. Even lifeless instruments —  
   flute or harp —  
   must give **distinct notes**,  
   or how will anyone know what is played?

8. For if the trumpet gives an **uncertain sound**,  
   who will prepare for battle?

9. So also you:  
   unless your tongue produces **clear speech**,  
   how will it be understood?  
   You will be speaking into the air.

10. There are many kinds of voices in the world,  
    and none is without meaning.

11. Therefore, if I do not understand the meaning,  
    I will be a **foreigner** to the speaker,  
    and he a foreigner to me.

12. Since you are eager for spiritual gifts,  
    seek to excel in **building up the assembly**.

---

# **Order, Edification, and Peace**

13. Therefore let the one who speaks in a tongue  
    pray that he may interpret.

14. For if I pray in a tongue,  
    my spirit prays,  
    but my mind is unfruitful.

15. What then?  
    I will pray with the spirit,  
    and I will pray with the mind also;  
    I will sing with the spirit,  
    and I will sing with the mind also.

16. Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit alone,  
    how will the one who occupies the place of the unlearned  
    say “Amen,”  
    since he does not understand what you say?

17. You indeed give thanks well,  
    but the other is not edified.

18. I thank my God  
    that I speak in tongues more than you all —

19. **yet in the assembly**  
    I would rather speak five words with understanding,  
    that I may instruct others also,  
    than ten thousand words in a tongue.

# **Stop Showing Off — Grow Up**

20. Brethren,  
    do not be children in understanding:  
    in malice be infants,  
    but in understanding be mature.

21. In the Law it is written:  
    “With men of other tongues and other lips  
    will I speak unto this people;  
    yet for all that they will not hear Me.”

22. Therefore tongues are for a **sign**,  
    not to those who believe,  
    but to the unbelieving;  
    but prophecy is for those who believe.

23. If the whole assembly speaks in tongues  
    and the unlearned enter,  
    will they not say you are **mad**?

24. But if all prophesy,  
    and the unbeliever enters,  
    he is **convicted**,  
    **examined**,  
    and the secrets of his heart are exposed;  
    and so, falling down,  
    he will worship God  
    and declare that God is truly among you.

# **Practical Order in Worship**

26. How is it, brethren?  
    When you gather:  
    each has a psalm,  
    a teaching,  
    a tongue,  
    a revelation,  
    an interpretation.  

    Let all things be done  
    for **edification**.

27. If anyone speaks in a tongue,  
    let it be two —  
    or at most three —  
    and each in turn,  
    with one interpreting.

28. But if there is no interpreter,  
    let him keep silence in the assembly;  
    let him speak to himself and to God.

29. Let two or three prophets speak,  
    and let the others judge.

30. If a revelation is given to another,  
    let the first hold his peace.

31. For you may all prophesy one by one,  
    that all may learn  
    and all may be comforted.

32. The spirits of the prophets  
    are subject to the prophets.

33. For **God is not the author of confusion,  
    but of peace**,  
    as in all assemblies of the saints.

# **Concluding Order**

40. Let all things  
    be done **decently**  
    and **in order**.

# **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**  
### *Poetic Alignment*

- Gifts shine  
  only where love leads.

- Ecstasy without clarity  
  leaves the assembly unfed.

- True spirituality speaks  
  **to the understanding**,  
  not the ego.

- Prophecy is not prediction —  
  it is **illumination**.

- Tongues stir the inner chamber;  
  prophecy lights the whole house.

- Disorder is not anointing.  
  Peace is the signature of God.

# **Symbolics Table**

| Term | BKV Meaning | Inner Principle |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Tongues** | Spirit-speech | Personal devotion that is not inherently edifying to others |
| **Prophecy** | Inspired instruction | Illumination, clarity, spiritual guidance |
| **Edification** | Building up | Strengthening the inner structure of the community/soul |
| **Confusion** | Disorder, fragmentation | Evidence of the ego, not the Spirit |
| **Peace** | Harmony and clarity | Signature of divine presence |
| **Interpretation** | Bridging of meaning | Translating inner experience into shared understanding |
| **Childishness** | Spiritual immaturity | Mistaking spectacle for spirituality |

---

# **Summary / Commentary**

### **1. The purpose of gifts is *edification*.**  
If it does not build up the community, it is not the Spirit leading — even if it feels spiritual.

### **2. Prophecy is superior because it clarifies.**  
Prophecy makes the hidden understandable.  
Tongues make the understandable hidden.

### **3. The Spirit produces peace, not chaos.**  
The Corinthian assembly confused frenzy with power.  
Paul corrects them firmly:

> “God is not the author of confusion.”

### **4. The standard of worship is intelligibility.**  
Even Paul says:  
“Five clear words > 10,000 opaque ones.”

### **5. True spirituality is maturity.**  
Not spectacle.  
Not self-display.  
Not noise.  
Not disordered emotion.  

**But love directing clarity toward the building of the body.**
