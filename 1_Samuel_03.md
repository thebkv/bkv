# **1 Samuel 3 — The Principle of Inner Hearing**
### *The Awakening of Prophetic Consciousness within the Soul*

> _“Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth.”_ — **1 Samuel 3 : 9 KJV**

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

### **I. The Silence before the Voice (vv 1–3)**  

The child **Samuel (Heard of God)** ministered unto the Source before **Eli (Uplifted Awareness)**, and the word of the Source was precious in those days; there was no open vision.  

*The inner voice lies dormant when awareness grows dim; truth is rare when receptivity is dull.*  

Eli lay in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim so that he could not see; and the lamp of the Source went out in the Temple where the Ark of God was.  

*This portrays the waning of old perception — the lamp of formal religion flickering as the new light awaits its awakening.*

### **II. The Calling (vv 4–10)**  

The Source called Samuel, and he answered, “Here am I.”  
He ran to Eli and said, “Here am I; for thou calledst me.”  
Eli said, “I called not; lie down again.”  

*The untrained intuition first mistakes the inner voice for outer authority.*

The Source called again; Samuel rose and went to Eli. Still he knew not the Source, for the word of the Source was not yet revealed unto him.  

On the third time, Eli perceived that the Source had called the child, and said,  
> “Go, lie down: and it shall be, if He call thee, that thou shalt say, ‘Speak, Source; for thy servant heareth.’ ”  

So Samuel lay down again. Then the Source came and stood, and called as at other times, “Samuel, Samuel.”  
And Samuel answered, “Speak; for thy servant heareth.”  

*The soul ceases to run outward and listens inward. Hearing is born of stillness.*

### **III. The Message (vv 11–18)**  

The Source said, “I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.”  
He announced the judgment upon Eli’s house: because his sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not.  

*When old awareness tolerates corruption, a new voice must arise to restore order.*

Samuel lay until the morning and opened the doors of the house of the Source. He feared to show Eli the vision.  
But Eli called him, and Samuel told him every whit. And Eli said, “It is the Source: let Him do what seemeth Him good.”  

*Old awareness bows to new illumination. Acceptance completes the transfer of authority.*

---

### **IV. The Establishment (vv 19–21)**  

Samuel grew, and the Source was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.  
All Israel knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the Source.  

*When the inner hearing is fully formed, its words carry creative power — every utterance becomes effective because it issues from alignment.*

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Samuel 3** portrays the shift from second-hand religion to direct revelation.  

- **Eli (Uplifted Awareness)** represents the waning rational mind — knowledge without fresh inspiration.  
- **Eli’s Dim Eyes** symbolize perception that knows of truth but no longer sees it.  
- **Samuel (Heard of God)** is the awakening of inner hearing — the faculty that receives living word from within.  
- The **three calls** represent the gradual training of intuition — recognition, discernment, response.  
- **“Speak, for thy servant heareth”** marks the moment of surrender when awareness stops interpreting and simply listens.  

From that moment, communication with the Divine becomes internal and continuous.

## **Addendum — The Law of Hearing**

The Voice of God is not new; only the listener awakens.  
Every call is answered in the same three motions:  
1. Recognition — awareness turns inward.  
2. Stillness — the will submits.  
3. Utterance — truth speaks through the soul.  

The old mind must dim for the inner ear to open; as Eli sleeps, Samuel rises.

## **Core BKV Principle — 1 Samuel 3**

> **When the soul ceases to seek truth from without and listens to the inner Voice, Prophetic Consciousness is born. The old awareness yields, and the living word speaks within.**
