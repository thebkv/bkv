# 1 SAMUEL 03 — Bible Key Version (BKV)
## **The Principle of Inner Hearing**
### *Distinguishing the Voice of the Source from the Noise of the Self*

---

## SUMMARY

**1 Samuel 3** records the decisive transition of spiritual authority from the old, failing priesthood (**Eli**) to the newly awakened prophetic faculty (**Samuel**).

The chapter opens with a striking condition:  
> *“The word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.”*  

This signals an inner drought — a state where divine communication is rare, unclear, and easily confused with familiar human voices.

Samuel hears the Source calling him three times, yet mistakes the call for Eli’s voice. This delay is not failure but training. The soul must learn to distinguish **direct spiritual prompting** from inherited authority, habit, and intellect. Once Samuel is taught how to listen properly, he receives a difficult but necessary revelation: the old order must fall.

From that moment forward, Samuel is established as a true prophet — one whose words do not fall to the ground.

# I. NATURAL READING (NR)

In the days when Samuel ministered before the LORD under Eli, visions were rare. Eli was old and nearly blind, and Samuel slept near the Ark of God in the tabernacle.

The LORD called Samuel, but Samuel assumed it was Eli and ran to him, saying, “Here am I.” Eli told him he had not called and sent him back to sleep. This happened three times.

At last, Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the boy. He instructed Samuel that when the voice came again, he should answer:

> **“Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth.”**

The LORD called again, and Samuel responded as instructed. The message revealed judgment against Eli’s house because Eli had failed to restrain his sons, honoring them above God.

Samuel was afraid to tell Eli, but in the morning he faithfully reported the word. Eli accepted it, saying, “It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.” Samuel grew, the LORD was with him, and all Israel recognized him as a true prophet.

# II. DEEP READING (DR)

This chapter depicts the **awakening of inner hearing**.

- **Samuel** represents the emerging faculty of **Spiritual Perception** — present, pure, but not yet trained.
- **Eli** represents **Intellectual Awareness** — sincere but fading, unable to see clearly, yet still capable of guiding the transition.

### **The Setting — Near the Ark**
Samuel sleeps near the Ark, where *the lamp of God had not yet gone out*.  
This shows that the new faculty is formed in the soul’s **consecrated center**, even while the old system loses vision.

### **The Three Calls**
The Source calls three times because the soul instinctively turns to **external authority** before trusting direct inner guidance.

- **First Call:** Reflexive dependence on the familiar voice  
- **Second Call:** Confirmation that the familiar cannot answer  
- **Third Call:** Recognition that the Source is speaking outside old channels  

### **Eli’s Final Service**
Though fading, Eli performs one essential task:  
he teaches Samuel **how to listen**.

> *“Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth.”*

This is the posture that allows true revelation — active invitation joined with complete surrender.

### **The First Message**
The initial revelation is not comforting but corrective.  
The Inner Voice does not flatter; it tells the truth.  
Before new order can stand, the old must be judged.

# III. COMMENTARY

### **The Transition of Authority**

| Old Authority | New Authority | Inner Meaning |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Eli** (old, blind) | **Samuel** (young, listening) | Intellectual awareness fades; spiritual perception awakens |
| **Priestly structure** | **Prophetic voice** | Form gives way to living revelation |
| **Passive acceptance** | **Active obedience** | Knowing yields to listening and action |

Eli accepts the word humbly, but he does not *become* the word.  
Samuel receives the word and lives from it.

### **The Formula for Inner Hearing**

Verse 9 contains the chapter’s central sentence:

> **“Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth.”**

This sentence has two movements:

1. **“Speak, LORD”** — recognition of divine authority and invitation  
2. **“thy servant heareth”** — surrender of ego, readiness to receive  

This posture moves the soul from confusion into clarity.

| **Samuel** | Spiritual Perception | Inner hearing; prophetic awareness |
| **Eli** | Fading Intellectual Awareness | Old spiritual structure nearing completion |
| **Three Calls** | Habitual Reliance on the External | The soul learning discernment |

# IN SUMMARY

**1 Samuel 3** is a tutorial in listening.

The Source is always speaking, but the soul must learn to distinguish divine prompting from familiar inner noise. The old authority may guide the transition, but it cannot carry the future.

When the ego finally yields and says,  
**“Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth,”**  
the inner voice becomes clear — and authority is established.
