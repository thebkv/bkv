# **1 Samuel 11 — The Principle of Zealous Victory**

> — **1 Samuel 11 : 6 KJV**

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

### **I. The Threat to Jabesh (vv 1–3)**  

**Nahash the Ammonite (Serpent of Oppression)** came up and encamped against **Jabesh-gilead (Dry Place of Witness)**.  
He said to the men of Jabesh,  
> “On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes.”  

*The Serpent always demands the blinding of vision — submission through partial sight.*  

The elders of Jabesh said, “Give us seven days to send messengers throughout Israel.”  
If no help came, they would surrender.  

*The weak faculties seek deliverance from the larger self; humility begins the appeal.*

### **II. The Stirring of Saul (vv 4–7)**  

The messengers came to **Gibeah of Saul (Hill of the Will)** and told the tidings.  
All the people lifted up their voices and wept.  

When Saul heard, **the Spirit of God came upon him**, and his anger was kindled greatly.  
He took a yoke of oxen, hewed them in pieces, and sent them throughout Israel, saying,  
> “Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen.”  

And the fear of the Source fell on the people, and they came out with one consent.  

*When the will aligns with prophetic purpose, even anger becomes consecrated energy.*

### **III. The Deliverance (vv 8–11)**  

Saul numbered the people and came upon the Ammonites suddenly in the morning watch.  
They slew them until the heat of the day, and those who remained were scattered.  

*Victory comes not by strategy but by unified motion under divine impulse.*  

The people said to Samuel,  
> “Who is he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? Bring the men, that we may put them to death.”  

But Saul said,  
> “There shall not a man be put to death this day: for today the Source hath wrought salvation in Israel.”  

*Mercy crowns victory — the will still remembers grace.*

### **IV. The Renewal at Gilgal (vv 12–15)**  

Samuel said,  
> “Come, and let us go to **Gilgal (Circle of Renewal)** and renew the kingdom there.”  

All the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the Source.  
They sacrificed peace offerings, and Saul and all Israel rejoiced greatly.  

*The circle completes — the anointed will stands confirmed; outer order appears whole.*

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Samuel 11** represents the *zenith of the Outer Will under Grace*.  
It is the brief harmony between prophetic guidance and human strength.

- **Nahash (Serpent)** = the oppressive power of sense-ego threatening perception.  
- **Jabesh-gilead (Dry Witness)** = the part of consciousness faithful but depleted, needing renewal.  
- **Saul’s Anger** = divine zeal awakening within the will — wrath as holy energy when guided by Spirit.  
- **Oxen Divided** = the decisive summons — the will demanding unity among faculties.  
- **Gilgal (Circle of Renewal)** = the state where victory is consecrated, not glorified.  

The Spirit uses the outer form to deliver, yet the form soon forgets the Source of its power.

## **Addendum — The Law of Zealous Victory**

Spirit sometimes seizes the outer will for its own deliverance work.  
Such victories are genuine but temporary; they reveal potential, not permanence.  
When zeal remains humble, the will serves; when it forgets its Source, pride begins its fall.  

Victory is not confirmation of supremacy, but reminder of stewardship.

## **Core BKV Principle — 1 Samuel 11**

> **When the will burns with consecrated zeal under divine impulse, oppression yields.  
> But unless humility guards victory, strength soon mistakes itself for the Source.**
