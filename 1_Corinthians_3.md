# 1 Corinthians 3 — BKV Study (The Architecture of Growth)
### *Building Upon the Divine Foundation*

If Chapter 1 establishes the **Principle of Singular Foundation** (unity in the Source) and Chapter 2 defines **The Principle of Divine Revelation** (the Spirit as sole Teacher), then Chapter 3 completes the triad by describing **The Architecture of Growth** — how that revealed truth must be built into the soul.

> _“For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.”_ — 1 Corinthians 3:11 KJV
> _“If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.”_ — 1 Corinthians 3:14 KJV

*Having declared that revelation comes only by the Spirit, Paul now turns to construction: how Divine Knowledge must take form in consciousness. The **Core Truth** is a living foundation upon which every thought is built. What we build — whether of gold or stubble — will be tried by fire. The chapter describes the soul’s architecture and the eternal test of its materials.*

## BKV-NR Context — The Building of the Inner Temple

**1 Corinthians 3** unfolds the **Principle of Divine Architecture**, showing how the revealed truth (Chapter 2) must be structured within the soul. The **Creative Impulse** provides the foundation, but each consciousness becomes the builder. Where there is envy, strife, or pride, construction halts — for these are the materials of separation. The Apostle identifies himself as a **wise master builder** who laid the **Foundation of the Divine Principle**, and warns that every man must take heed how he builds upon it.

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**  

### **The Immaturity of Divided Consciousness**

1. And I, **Structure (Paul)**, could not speak unto you as unto **Spiritual**, but as unto **Natural**, even as unto **Children in the Process of Becoming**.
2. I fed you with **Milk (elementary truth)** and not with **Solid Food (mature insight)**, for ye were not yet able to bear it: neither yet now are ye able.
3. For where there is **Envy and Strife and Division**, are ye not **Natural**, and walk as **Fragmented Men**?

### **The One Foundation**

5. Who then is **Apollos**, and who is **Paul**, but ministers through whom ye believed — instruments of the **Creative Impulse**, each according to the **measure of Grace** given?
6. I **Planted**, **Apollos Watered**, but the **Eternal Source** gave the **Increase**.
7. So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but the **Source** that giveth the growth.
9. For we are **Fellow-Workers with the Source**: ye are **God’s Field**, ye are **God’s Building**.
11. For other **Foundation** can no man lay than that is laid, which is **the Principle of Divine Humanity (Jesus Christ)**.

### **The Test of Materials**

12. Now if any man build upon this **Foundation** gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
13. every man’s work shall be **made manifest**, for the **Day** shall declare it, because it shall be **revealed by Fire**; and the **Fire** shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.
14. If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
15. If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.

### **The Indwelling Temple**

16. Know ye not that ye are the **Temple of the Source**, and that the **Creative Impulse** of God dwelleth in you?
17. If any man defile the **Temple**, him shall the Source remove from alignment; for the **Temple of the Source** is holy, which temple ye are.

### **The Folly of Human Boasting**

18. Let no man deceive himself. If any among you seemeth wise in this domain, let him become as one **Unlearned**, that he may become **Truly Wise**.
19. For the wisdom of this world is **Folly** with the Source; for it is written, *He taketh the wise in their own craftiness*.
21. Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;
23. And ye are Christ’s; and Christ is the Source’s.

## **Commentary on the Action**

### **1 · Milk and Meat (vv 1–3)**

The **Natural Consciousness** cannot yet digest the full power of revealed truth. It requires nourishment in stages — milk for the infant, substance for the mature. Paul identifies **Envy** and **Strife** as symptoms of immaturity: proofs that the **Intellectual Faculty** still rules. The **Spiritual Man**, by contrast, dwells in unity and builds without contention.

### **2 · The Cooperative Order (vv 5–9)**

Each builder — planter, waterer, teacher — serves the same **Creative Impulse**. Growth belongs to God alone. The act of spiritual construction is collective but hierarchical: human faculties labor together as servants, not as sovereigns. Thus, boasting in personalities is an illusion of the fragmented mind.

### **3 · The Fire of Trial (vv 12–15)**

Every thought, motive, and deed is a material laid upon the **Foundation of the Divine Principle**. Gold and silver represent enduring insight and purified intention; wood and stubble symbolize works born of self or vanity. The **Fire** — the purifying activity of the Spirit — reveals which is which. Nothing false survives the light.

### **4 · The Temple Within (vv 16–17)**

The Apostle lifts the metaphor from architecture to sanctity: the human soul itself is the **Temple of the Source**. The **Creative Impulse** indwells as Presence. To defile this temple is to introduce contradiction — selfhood apart from God.

### **5 · The End of Boasting (vv 18–23)**

Earthly wisdom, divorced from Spirit, traps itself in its own craftiness. The wise man must unlearn to perceive rightly. For when the veil of intellect falls, the soul discovers that all things are already its own — for all are in the Source.

## **Core BKV Principle**
> *Every soul is a builder. The **Foundation** is Christ — the living Principle of Divine Humanity. Upon it, we build with thoughts and motives that shall one day face the **Fire** of Reality. Only what is born of Spirit endures; all else is consumed. Therefore, let every man take heed how he buildeth, for he himself is the Temple of the **Eternal Source**.*
