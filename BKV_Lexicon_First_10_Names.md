## BKV Lexicon — The Ten Names of Genesis

---

### **1. Adam (אָדָם)**
**Meaning:** *Man; Of the Earth*  
**Root Sense:** From *adamah* — “ground, red earth.”  
**Inner Principle:** The emergence of conscious individuality formed from the ground of divine substance.  
**Symbolic Phase:** The awakening of self-awareness — the point where spirit takes form.  
**BKV Interpretation:**  
> Adam represents the first recognition of individuality — divine breath clothed in matter. He is the beginning of human consciousness: spirit discovering itself within limitation.

---

### **2. Seth (שֵׁת)**
**Meaning:** *Appointed; Established; Placed*  
**Root Sense:** From *shith* — “to set, appoint, establish.”  
**Inner Principle:** The establishment of divine intention within the mortal line — the principle of spiritual succession.  
**Symbolic Phase:** The seed of restoration after loss.  
**BKV Interpretation:**  
> Seth signifies the appointed continuation of divine purpose. After the fall of earlier impulses, God sets in motion a new pattern of order and promise.

---

### **3. Enosh (אֱנוֹשׁ)**
**Meaning:** *Mortal Man; Frail Humanity*  
**Root Sense:** From *enosh* — “man, mortal, weak.”  
**Inner Principle:** Awareness of mortality; recognition of human limitation apart from the Divine.  
**Symbolic Phase:** The dawning humility of the soul.  
**BKV Interpretation:**  
> Enosh marks the awakening of human frailty — the soul realizing its dependence on God. The bright pride of Adam becomes softened into humility and longing.

---

### **4. Kenan (קֵינָן)**
**Meaning:** *Mortal Possession (Sorrow)*  
**Root Sense:** From *qanah* (“to acquire, possess”) and *qinah* (“lamentation, sorrow”).  
**Inner Principle:** The illusion that what is mortal can be possessed; the sorrow born from attachment.  
**Symbolic Phase:** The passage from grasping to grief.  
**BKV Interpretation:**  
> Kenan embodies the ache of the soul that clings to the transient. It learns through loss that nothing external can be kept. Mortal possession and sorrow are the same condition — the awareness that prepares the heart for praise.

---

### **5. Mahalalel (מַהֲלַלְאֵל)**
**Meaning:** *The Praise of God*  
**Root Sense:** From *halal* (“praise”) + *El* (“God”).  
**Inner Principle:** Rejoicing that arises after surrender; illumination following sorrow.  
**Symbolic Phase:** The transition from lament to worship.  
**BKV Interpretation:**  
> Mahalalel is the breakthrough of praise — the soul’s first upward song. Having lost all it clung to, it discovers the inner joy that cannot be taken away.

---

### **6. Jared (יָרֶד)**
**Meaning:** *He Descends*  
**Root Sense:** From *yarad* — “to descend, go down.”  
**Inner Principle:** The movement of divine energy into manifestation; the descent of inspiration into human form.  
**Symbolic Phase:** Revelation entering experience.  
**BKV Interpretation:**  
> Jared represents the descent of the heavenly into the earthly. The Divine begins to touch the depths of the human mind, preparing it for transformation.

---

### **7. Enoch (חֲנוֹךְ)**
**Meaning:** *Dedicated; Initiated; Taught*  
**Root Sense:** From *chanak* — “to dedicate, train, initiate.”  
**Inner Principle:** The consecration of life to divine instruction.  
**Symbolic Phase:** The schooling of the soul.  
**BKV Interpretation:**  
> Enoch is the stage of inner dedication — the soul trained by Spirit until it walks in continual fellowship with God. This is disciplined devotion becoming delight.

---

### **8. Methuselah (מְתוּשֶׁלַח)**
**Meaning:** *When He Dies, It Shall Be Sent* (or *Man of the Dart*)  
**Root Sense:** Possibly from *muth* (“to die”) + *shalach* (“to send”).  
**Inner Principle:** The awareness of mortality as a signal of transition — that endings release divine purpose.  
**Symbolic Phase:** Anticipation of judgment and renewal.  
**BKV Interpretation:**  
> Methuselah personifies the wisdom that perceives time’s approach. His life marks a boundary: when the old dies, something divinely sent arrives. The long patience of God before a cleansing change.

---

### **9. Lamech (לֶמֶךְ)**
**Meaning:** *Powerful; Stricken; Strong One* (root uncertain)  
**Root Sense:** Possibly linked to *lamak* — “to humble” or “to strike.”  
**Inner Principle:** The crisis of strength — when power turns upon itself and discovers its weakness.  
**Symbolic Phase:** The breaking of the old self.  
**BKV Interpretation:**  
> Lamech is the confrontation with one’s own force. It is the collapse of human might under divine reality — the sorrow of self-will yielding to surrender.

---

### **10. Noah (נֹחַ)**
**Meaning:** *Rest; Comfort*  
**Root Sense:** From *nuach* — “to rest, settle, comfort.”  
**Inner Principle:** The peace that follows purification; the soul’s resting in divine order.  
**Symbolic Phase:** The Sabbath consciousness — inner stillness.  
**BKV Interpretation:**  
> Noah is the reward of surrender — rest born of trust. The storm subsides, the ark settles, and the soul finds peace within the covenant of renewal.

---

### **Summary Flow**
> **Adam** – Man (Spirit in matter)  
> **Seth** – Appointed  
> **Enosh** – Mortal  
> **Kenan** – Possession (Sorrow)  
> **Mahalalel** – The Praise of God  
> **Jared** – Shall Descend  
> **Enoch** – Teaching / Initiation  
> **Methuselah** – His Death Shall Bring  
> **Lamech** – Strength (Broken / Humbled)  
> **Noah** – Rest / Comfort  

→ Together they form the archetypal progression:  
**“Man appointed mortal possession and sorrow; the Praise of God shall descend, initiating through death and renewal the humbled strength that finds rest.”**

### **The Internal Genealogy (Genesis 5:1-29, Allegorical Rendering)**

**1. Adam:**
* The human consciousness, which is the initial expression of the Divine, yet is bound to form.

**2. Seth:**
* A purposeful design is **appointed** for this consciousness, a divine trajectory toward awakening.

**3. Enosh:**
* But in its unawakened state, this consciousness experiences the **mortal sorrow** of transience and limitation.

**4. Kenan:**
* Through this experience, the self makes the **acquisition** of the feeling of pain and separation (**Sin**).

**5. Mahalalel:**
* Yet, the **Blessed God**—The Source, who is inherently good and filled with **Oil of Gladness**—remains the true and eternal reality.

**6. Jared:**
* This Divine Principle **shall come down**; the Consciousness-of-the-Divine is destined to manifest within the human vessel.

**7. Enoch:**
* The inner truth is **dedicated** to **teaching** the self, revealing the path of **Righteousness** and the Divine order.

**8. Methuselah:**
* The death of the separate, egoic self (**Pharaoh**) is inevitable; **his death shall bring** the end of the old condition.

**9. Lamech:**
* The lower nature, in its final throes of self-exaltation (**Boasting**), becomes **despairing** as its fragmentation is exposed.

**10. Noah:**
* This great transformation leads to inner **Rest/Comfort** and **Salvation**, which is the **Union with the Ultimate** and the fulfillment of human destiny.

### **Interpretive Summary**

The sequence of ten primordial names forms a complete allegorical sentence that maps the soul's journey from a state of separation to **At-one-ment**.

* **The Narrative Arc:** The lineage establishes that the **Man (Adam)**, despite being **appointed** for a divine life, experiences **mortal sorrow** because of **Sin** (separation).
* **The Divine Intervention (Redemption):** The turning point begins at **Mahalalel (The Blessed God)**, who **shall come down (Jared)** in the form of inner **Teaching (Enoch)**—the Consciousness-of-the-Divine. This teaches the self that the only path to liberation requires the "death" of the limited, lower nature (represented by **Methuselah**'s meaning).
* **The Resolution:** This necessary spiritual humbling (**Suffering**) overcomes the **despairing (Lamech)** resistance of the ego, leading inexorably to the final state of inner **Rest/Comfort (Noah)**, which is complete **Justification** and spiritual **Dominion**.

The BKV understands this "prophetic sentence" as a blueprint for the personal and internal awakening that must occur within every human consciousness.
