# Odyssey Book I — VBV

SUMMARY  
The poem opens by establishing a scattered identity held in restraint, a household strained by misuse, and an inheritance not yet claimed. Authority is present but withheld; guidance is offered without force. The chapter prepares the ground for recovery without yet allowing return.

| Pope (Baseline) | VBV |
|---|---|
| The man for wisdom’s various arts renown’d, | The man formed by many turns is named. |
| Long exercised in woes, O Muse! resound; | His endurance, not his ease, is invoked. |
| Who, when his arms had wrought the destined fall | After the war’s end, his wandering continues. |
| Of sacred Troy, and razed her heaven-built wall, | Victory does not conclude his journey. |
| Wandering from clime to clime, observant stray’d, | He moves across lands, learning through passage. |
| Their manners noted, and their states survey’d; | He encounters systems, not homes. |
| On stormy seas unnumber’d toils he bore, | Resistance, not defeat, defines the delay. |
| Safe with his friends to gain his natal shore: | Return remains oriented, not achieved. |
| Vain toils! their impious folly dared to prey | Others fall by self-excess, not fate. |
| On herds devoted to the god of day; | Boundaries are crossed without regard. |
| The god vindictive doom’d them never more | Consumption without measure ends in loss. |
| (Ah men unbless’d!) to touch that natal shore. | They forfeit return through misuse. |
| O snatch some portion of these acts from fate, | The telling itself becomes an act of ordering. |
| Celestial Muse! and to our world relate. | Memory is invoked to hold the pattern. |
| Now at their native realms the Greeks arrived; | Others are restored; one is withheld. |
| All who the war of ten long years survived; | Survival does not equal completion. |
| Safe in their wives’ embrace, or free at least | Return is common; this case is not. |
| Of sorrow, toil, and care, the novel guest | The exception defines the story. |
| Alone, of all the victor train, bereft | One remains suspended. |
| Of love and glory, to his island left, | Home exists, but is inaccessible. |
| Calypso in her caves constrained his stay, | Delay is enforced by holding, not ignorance. |
| With sweet detentions woo’d the reluctant way; | Desire attempts to replace purpose. |
| But now, the circling years disclose the day | Time, not struggle, turns the hinge. |
| The day predestined by the wrathful sky, | Release comes by order, not impulse. |
| When homeward to his native isle he flies. | Return is released, not seized. |
| Athena now, with pity touched, reviews | Oversight resumes attention. |
| The long vicissitudes of wandering woes; | The pattern is seen whole. |
| And asks the gods to speed his safe return, | Guidance is requested, not forced. |
| And move the dread decree of stern Saturn. | Authority consents to motion. |
| Meanwhile Telemachus, the blooming heir | The successor exists but is unformed. |
| Of sea-girt Ithaca, convened the fair; | He gathers voice before authority. |
| The assembled peers into the palace came; | Order still recognizes its place. |
| Then first he spoke, while tears relieved his flame; | Emotion precedes command. |
| No more, my friends, shall anxious care engage | He names the disorder without solving it. |
| The drooping spirits of my tender age; | Identity seeks reinforcement. |
| Ill suits it me to search the spacious main, | He is not yet fitted for the task. |
| Or launch a voyage to the realms of Spain; | Action is deferred. |
| Yet still the tears in bounteous flow descend, | Readiness is emotional, not structural. |
| While absent fathers are the youth’s lament. | Loss is named, not resolved. |
| Athena, pleased, assumes a friendly face; | Guidance approaches indirectly. |
| A form like Mentor’s, famed for ancient grace; | Authority teaches by resemblance. |
| She bids him rise, the suitors’ wrongs withstand, | Preparation begins, not conquest. |
| And learn betimes to rule his native land. | Identity is oriented toward future order. |
