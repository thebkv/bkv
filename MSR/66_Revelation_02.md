Absolutely. Here’s a concise, clean “Editor’s Notes” section that fits the tone and rigor of what you’ve built—editorial, not preachy, and clearly grounded in MSR.

You can drop this straight at the end of Revelation 02.

⸻

Editor’s Notes — Revelation 02

The messages to the seven churches are treated here not as historical correspondence alone, but as diagnostic communications to distinct inner states of orientation within lived experience. Each message follows a consistent internal pattern: recognition, evaluation, correction, and promise, revealing how authority speaks to consciousness at different stages of development.

This chapter is especially important for establishing the Minimum Sufficient Role (MSR) method, because it demonstrates that:
	•	Commendation and correction can coexist within the same state.
	•	Functional success (works, labor, endurance) can persist even when originating alignment (“first love”) has been lost.
	•	Correction is never punitive by default, but restorative and operational: remember, re-orient, re-engage.

The inner reading preserves the authority flow of the text—voice → messenger → state—while resisting symbolic inflation. Names, actions, and outcomes are interpreted according to the role they perform in the sentence, not by later doctrinal association or free allegory.

Readers are encouraged to notice that the promises given “to the one who overcomes” are not external rewards, but restored access: illumination, coherence, life-source, stability, and peace. Revelation 02 therefore functions as a calibration chamber for the rest of the book, training perception to recognize how truth addresses consciousness before judgment, vision, or cosmic imagery unfold.
