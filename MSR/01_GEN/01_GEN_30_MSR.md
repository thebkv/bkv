## Local Symbol Mapping Key (Genesis 30)

- **Rachel** → **Longing for fulfillment / “I must have” orientation**
- **Leah** → **Fruitfulness through endurance / “I keep bearing” orientation**
- **Jacob** → **Directed will / identity-building effort**
- **Bilhah / Zilpah** → **Delegated means / proxy strategies**
- **Children** → **Outcomes / realized states**
- **Mandrakes** → **Fertility leverage / transactional desire**
- **Laban** → **External control system / negotiated constraint**
- **Wages** → **Terms of increase / bargain-structure**
- **Flocks** → **Multiplying resources / visible increase**

## Genesis 30:1–8 — Demand, Proxy, and Forced Increase

| King James Version | MSR Rendering (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And when **Rachel** saw that she bare **Jacob** no children, **Rachel** envied her sister; and said unto **Jacob**, Give me children, or else I die. | When **longing** perceives no **outcome**, it turns to **comparison**, then demands **increase** from **directed will**, treating fulfillment as survival. |
| And **Jacob’s anger** was kindled against **Rachel**… Am I in God’s stead…? | **Directed will** resists being treated as **Source**, refusing the role of originator of life. |
| Behold my maid **Bilhah**… she shall bear upon my knees… | **Longing** introduces a **proxy strategy**—outsourcing increase to **delegated means** to obtain an outcome. |
| …and she called his name **Dan**… **Naphtali**… | **Longing** names the results as **vindication** and **striving**, revealing the inner motive driving the method. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Role: the system tries to force increase by **pressure** and **proxy** rather than alignment ✔  
- Minimum sufficiency: the chapter frames “increase” as an *inner problem of method and motive*, not biology-only ✔  
**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Stable)

**BAC:**  
**Rachel ⇄ Longing** ✔ **Jacob ⇄ Directed Will** ✔ **Children ⇄ Outcomes** ✔ **Bilhah ⇄ Proxy Strategy** ✔

## Genesis 30:9–13 — Rivalry Escalates into Delegation

| King James Version | MSR Rendering (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| When **Leah** saw that she had left bearing… she took **Zilpah**… and gave her to **Jacob** to wife. | **Enduring fruitfulness** pauses, and rivalry converts even fruitfulness into **strategy**, delegating increase through **proxy means**. |
| …and she called his name **Gad**… **Asher**… | Outcomes are named as **fortune** and **happiness**, showing the craving is now not just children—but *status and emotional proof*. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Role: competition turns increase into a **scoreboard** ✔  
- Minimum sufficiency: proxy use is shown as functional escalation ✔  
**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Stable)

**BAC:**  
**Leah ⇄ Enduring Fruitfulness** ✔ **Zilpah ⇄ Proxy Strategy** ✔

## Genesis 30:14–21 — Transactional Desire and the Price of Access

| King James Version | MSR Rendering (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| **Reuben** found **mandrakes**… and brought them unto **Leah**. Then **Rachel** said… Give me… mandrakes. | A “fertility leverage” object enters the system, and **longing** attempts to obtain increase by **transaction**, not transformation. |
| Is it a small matter… hast taken my husband?… wilt thou take… mandrakes also? | The rivalry exposes **scarcity thinking**: access to love and access to increase become commodities. |
| Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son’s mandrakes. | The system accepts **bargained intimacy**—a functional picture of increase pursued through **deal-making**. |
| And God hearkened unto **Leah**… and she bare… and called his name **Issachar**… **Zebulun**… and afterward… **Dinah**. | Despite the flawed bargaining, **Source** still produces outcomes: **wages**, **dwelling**, and an added outcome not framed as rivalry. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Role: “mandrakes” function as **misplaced control**—trying to purchase what must be granted ✔  
- Minimum sufficiency: the text shows that even when outcomes come, the *inner motive is still being exposed* ✔  
**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Stable)

**BAC:**  
**Mandrakes ⇄ Fertility Leverage/Transaction** ✔ **Wages ⇄ Terms of Increase** ✔

## Genesis 30:22–24 — Fulfillment Granted, Not Engineered

| King James Version | MSR Rendering (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And God remembered **Rachel**… and opened her womb. | **Source** re-enters as the decisive actor: fulfillment arrives by **grant**, not technique. |
| …and she called his name **Joseph**; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son. | The outcome is named **Increase-Continues**, revealing that even answered longing can still aim at “more” rather than rest. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Role: shift from rivalry/technique → **Source-granted opening** ✔  
**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Stable)

**BAC:**  
**Rachel ⇄ Longing** ✔ **Joseph ⇄ Increase-Continues** ✔

## Genesis 30:25–36 — Negotiated Wages and Separated Gain

| King James Version | MSR Rendering (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| …Send me away… give me my wives… and my children… | **Directed will** seeks exit from the **control system** once increase has reached critical mass. |
| …I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake. | The **external system** recognizes that blessing can flow *through* alignment it does not possess. |
| Appoint me thy wages… | Increase is converted into **contract terms**. |
| …every one that is speckled and spotted… shall be my hire. | **Separated gain** is defined: marked increase becomes the boundary of ownership. |
| …and he removed… three days’ journey… | The **control system** tries to manage the outcome by **distance and separation**, attempting to limit increase. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Role: the narrative shifts from “childbearing rivalry” to “resource rivalry” — same pattern, new domain ✔  
**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Stable)

**BAC:**  
**Laban ⇄ Control System** ✔ **Wages ⇄ Contract Terms** ✔ **Spotted/Speckled ⇄ Marked Gain** ✔

## Genesis 30:37–43 — Technique-Based Control Produces Visible Increase

| King James Version | MSR Rendering (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And **Jacob** took him rods… pilled white strakes… set the rods before the flocks… | **Directed will** employs **technique-based control**, attempting to steer increase through method. |
| …the flocks brought forth ringstraked, speckled, and spotted. | The system yields **marked increase**, reinforcing the sense that technique can govern outcomes. |
| …the man increased exceedingly… | The chapter closes with **visible multiplication**, but without inner rest—showing increase can arrive while motive remains unresolved. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Role: “rods” are not magic; they function as *the psyche’s attempt to engineer blessing* ✔  
- Minimum sufficiency: the text reports technique and outcome while setting up later correction (alignment vs manipulation) ✔  
**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Context-Dependent; requires later cross-check with Genesis 31)

**BAC:**  
**Jacob ⇄ Directed Will** ✔ **Rods ⇄ Technique-Control** ✔ **Flocks ⇄ Multiplying Resources** ✔ **Increase ⇄ Visible Multiplication** ✔
