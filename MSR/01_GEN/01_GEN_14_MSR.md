# Genesis 14 — Rescue Without Domination
## MSR Architectural Reading (Two-Column Tables)

---

## MSR Preface (Genesis 14)

Genesis 14 introduces **conflict, alliance, and rescue**—but under MSR it is not a lesson in conquest.
It reveals how **right authority intervenes to restore what was taken**, then **refuses ownership, tribute, or domination**.

> **True authority rescues without absorbing.**

This chapter tests whether strength will become possession.

## Local MSR Mapping Key (Genesis 14)

- **Kings** → **Governing powers / organizing authorities**
- **War** → **Systemic conflict between authority structures**
- **Captivity** → **Loss of rightful agency**
- **Lot** → **Relational identity tied to Abram**
- **Abram** → **Aligned authority under Source**
- **Melchizedek** → **Priestly authority of alignment (order without lineage)**
- **Bread and Wine** → **Sustaining provision, not reward**
- **Tithe** → **Recognition of higher order**
- **King of Sodom** → **Transactional authority**
- **Spoils** → **Claimed outcomes of domination**

## Genesis 14:1–4 — Competing Authorities

| Narrative Text (KJV) | MSR Functional Reading |
|---|---|
| Kings arise and make war; some rule, others rebel. | **Competing authority systems** contend; stability fractures under domination. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Role: establish a field of **authority conflict** ✔  
- Minimum sufficiency: power structures, not personalities ✔  
**BAC:** **Kings ⇄ Governing Powers**, **War ⇄ Systemic Conflict** ✔

---

## Genesis 14:5–7 — Expansion of Conflict

| Narrative Text (KJV) | MSR Functional Reading |
|---|---|
| Campaigns spread; territories are overrun. | **Domination propagates**, extending control beyond original bounds. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Role: show **unchecked expansion** ✔  
**BAC:** **Territories ⇄ Domains of Influence** ✔

---

## Genesis 14:8–12 — Loss Through Proximity

| Narrative Text (KJV) | MSR Functional Reading |
|---|---|
| Sodom falls; **Lot is taken captive**. | **Relational identity** is compromised when embedded in unstable authority. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Role: explain *why* rescue becomes necessary ✔  
**BAC:** **Lot ⇄ Relational Identity**, **Captive ⇄ Loss of Agency** ✔

---

## Genesis 14:13–16 — Rescue Without Conquest

| Narrative Text (KJV) | MSR Functional Reading |
|---|---|
| **Abram pursues**, defeats the captors, **restores Lot and goods**. | **Aligned authority intervenes**, restores what was taken, and **withdraws**. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Role: demonstrate **intervention without takeover** ✔  
- Minimum sufficiency: rescue, not regime change ✔  
**BAC:** **Abram ⇄ Aligned Authority**, **Restore ⇄ Reinstatement** ✔

---

## Genesis 14:17–20 — Recognition of Higher Order

| Narrative Text (KJV) | MSR Functional Reading |
|---|---|
| **Melchizedek** blesses Abram; **bread and wine** are given; Abram **tithes**. | **Priestly authority** affirms alignment; **recognition flows upward**, not inward. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Role: confirm **legitimacy without transaction** ✔  
**BAC:** **Melchizedek ⇄ Priestly Order**, **Bread/Wine ⇄ Sustenance**, **Tithe ⇄ Recognition** ✔

---

## Genesis 14:21–24 — Refusal of Ownership

| Narrative Text (KJV) | MSR Functional Reading |
|---|---|
| King of Sodom offers spoils; **Abram refuses**. | **True authority rejects dependency**, refuses to be **enriched by domination**. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Role: close the test—**power without possession** ✔  
**BAC:** **Spoils ⇄ Ownership Claim**, **Refusal ⇄ Non-Domination** ✔

---

## MSR Summary

- Authority may **enter conflict** to restore what was taken.
- Authority must **exit without claim**.
- Recognition belongs to **higher order**, not transactional systems.
- **Rescue does not entitle possession**.

Genesis 14 proves that alignment can wield strength **without becoming a system of control**.

**Status:**  
- MSR: ✔ Stable  
- Functional coherence preserved  
- Ready to proceed to **Genesis 15 — Promise Without Coercion**
