## King James Text with MSR / BKV Rendering
### Using the **Minimum Sufficient Role (MSR)** Method  
*(Two-column comparison with per-section MSR Check and Bold Audit Check)*

## MSR Preface (Matthew-Specific)

Matthew 01 is not genealogy for record-keeping.

Under **Minimum Sufficient Role (MSR)**, this chapter functions as an **authority-validation document**.  
It establishes that the arrival of Jesus is **structurally lawful**, **internally coherent**, and **aligned with promise**.

The genealogy is not about bloodline pride.  
It is about **the lawful transfer of authority through ordered promise**, despite failure, exile, and interruption.

Nothing here requires:
- racial exceptionalism  
- biological determinism  
- mythic ancestry inflation  

Everything is interpreted **only by the role it performs in establishing legitimacy and readiness**.

## Core MSR Principle for Matthew 01

> **Authority arrives lawfully through alignment, not purity of lineage.**

## Matthew 1:1 — The Title Sentence

| King James Version | BKV (MSR Rendering) |
|---|---|
| The **book of the generation of Jesus Christ**, the **son of David**, the **son of Abraham**. | The **record of lawful origin** of **Anointed Authority**, established through **kingly promise** and **foundational covenant**. |

**MSR Check**
- Sentence role: establishes jurisdiction and scope ✔  
- David = kingship; Abraham = promise ✔  

**BAC**
- **Book ⇄ Record**
- **Generation ⇄ Lawful Origin**
- **Jesus Christ ⇄ Anointed Authority**
- **David ⇄ Kingship Promise**
- **Abraham ⇄ Foundational Covenant**

## Matthew 1:2–6a — From Abraham to David (Promise → Nation → Kingship)

*(Grouped due to shared function)*

| King James Version | BKV (MSR Rendering) |
|---|---|
| **Abraham** begat **Isaac**; and **Isaac** begat **Jacob**; and **Jacob** begat **Judas** and his brethren; … and **Jesse** begat **David** the king; | **Promise** produces **continuity**, continuity produces **identity**, identity produces **structure**, until **governing authority** is established. |

**MSR Check**
- Function: show lawful emergence of authority ✔  
- Failures are not hidden ✔  

**BAC**
- **Abraham ⇄ Promise**
- **Isaac ⇄ Continuity**
- **Jacob ⇄ Identity Formation**
- **Judas ⇄ Tribal Continuity**
- **David ⇄ Legitimate Kingship**

## Matthew 1:6b–11 — From David to the Exile (Authority → Corruption → Collapse)

| King James Version | BKV (MSR Rendering) |
|---|---|
| And **David** the king begat **Solomon** of her that had been the wife of **Urias**; … until the **carrying away into Babylon**. | **Authority** continues through **compromised succession**, declining through **misaligned rule**, until **collapse and removal** become necessary. |

**MSR Check**
- Function: shows lawful authority can still decay ✔  
- Babylon = consequence, not accident ✔  

**BAC**
- **Solomon ⇄ Compromised Authority**
- **Kings ⇄ Delegated Rule**
- **Babylon ⇄ Forced Reorientation**

---

## Matthew 1:12–16 — From Exile to Jesus (Preservation → Quiet Alignment)

| King James Version | BKV (MSR Rendering) |
|---|---|
| And after they were brought to **Babylon**, **Jechonias** begat **Salathiel**… and **Jacob** begat **Joseph** the husband of **Mary**, of whom was born **Jesus**, who is called **Christ**. | After **dislocation**, authority is **preserved quietly**, culminating not in power but in **prepared alignment**, through which **Anointed Authority** emerges. |

**MSR Check**
- Function: legitimacy preserved without visibility ✔  
- Joseph holds authority but does not originate it ✔  

**BAC**
- **Babylon ⇄ Dislocation**
- **Joseph ⇄ Custodial Authority**
- **Mary ⇄ Receptive Alignment**
- **Jesus ⇄ Emergent Anointed Authority**

---

## Matthew 1:17 — Structural Summary

| King James Version | BKV (MSR Rendering) |
|---|---|
| So all the generations from **Abraham** to **David** are fourteen generations; and from **David** until the **carrying away into Babylon** are fourteen generations; and from the **carrying away into Babylon** unto **Christ** are fourteen generations. | Authority progresses in **ordered phases**: **promise**, **rule**, **collapse**, and **restoration**, each complete and sufficient for the next. |

**MSR Check**
- Numbers signal structure, not mysticism ✔  

**BAC**
- **Generations ⇄ Ordered Phases**
- **Christ ⇄ Fulfilled Authority**

---

## Matthew 1:18–19 — The Problem Introduced

| King James Version | BKV (MSR Rendering) |
|---|---|
| Now the **birth of Jesus Christ** was on this wise: When as his mother **Mary** was espoused to **Joseph**, before they came together, she was found with child of the **Holy Ghost**. | The arrival of **Anointed Authority** does not proceed by **human mechanism**, creating a **crisis of interpretation** for lawful authority. |

**MSR Check**
- Function: introduces tension between law and revelation ✔  

**BAC**
- **Birth ⇄ Arrival**
- **Holy Ghost ⇄ Source Initiation**

---

## Matthew 1:20–21 — Resolution by Alignment, Not Control

| King James Version | BKV (MSR Rendering) |
|---|---|
| But while he thought on these things, behold, the **angel of the Lord** appeared unto him in a dream… for that which is conceived in her is of the **Holy Ghost**. | **Messenger awareness** resolves lawful fear by revealing **Source-initiated purpose**, not moral failure. |

**MSR Check**
- Function: authority submits to revelation ✔  

**BAC**
- **Angel ⇄ Messenger Awareness**
- **Dream ⇄ Internal Reception**
- **Holy Ghost ⇄ Source Action**

---

## Matthew 1:22–23 — Prophetic Legitimacy

| King James Version | BKV (MSR Rendering) |
|---|---|
| Behold, a **virgin** shall be with child… and they shall call his name **Emmanuel**, which being interpreted is, **God with us**. | Alignment fulfills promise: **Presence**, not distance, defines restored authority. |

**MSR Check**
- Function: confirms continuity, not novelty ✔  

**BAC**
- **Virgin ⇄ Uninitiated Source**
- **Emmanuel ⇄ Presence Realized**

---

## Matthew 1:24–25 — Authority Yields Without Possession

| King James Version | BKV (MSR Rendering) |
|---|---|
| Then **Joseph**… did as the **angel of the Lord** had bidden him… and called his name **Jesus**. | Lawful authority **protects and names**, but does not **originate or control**, allowing **Anointed Authority** to emerge intact. |

**MSR Check**
- Function: authority completes its role and steps aside ✔  

**BAC**
- **Joseph ⇄ Lawful Stewardship**
- **Jesus ⇄ Saving Authority**

---

## MSR Chapter Summary (Minimal and Complete)

Matthew 01 establishes that:

- Authority must arrive lawfully  
- Lineage preserves promise even through failure  
- Alignment matters more than purity  
- True authority does not seize control  
- Presence, not power, is the fulfillment  

Nothing more is required for the chapter to function.  
Nothing less will suffice.

**Status**
- MSR: ✔ Stable  
- BAC: ✔ Complete
