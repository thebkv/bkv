## Daniel 12:1

| KJV | VBV (MSR) |
|---|---|
| And at that time shall **Michael** stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a **time of trouble**, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the **book**. | At the threshold, **protective ordering authority** asserts itself as the system enters a **maximum stress condition**. Deliverance occurs only for identities aligned with the **register of true coherence**. |

**MSR Check:** Crisis triggers ordering, not chaos ✔  
**BAC:** Michael ⇄ Protective Authority ✔ Book ⇄ True Identity ✔

---

## Daniel 12:2

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| And many of them that **sleep in the dust** of the earth shall **awake**, some to **everlasting life**, and some to **shame and everlasting contempt**. | Dormant identities **reactivate**: some stabilize into **coherent continuity**, others are exposed as **fragmented and unsustainable**. |

**MSR Check:** Awakening reveals, not creates, identity ✔  
**BAC:** Sleep ⇄ Dormancy ✔ Awake ⇄ Reactivation ✔

---

## Daniel 12:3

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| And they that be **wise** shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the **stars** for ever and ever. | **Aligned interpreters** become stable reference points, guiding others into coherence with enduring clarity. |

**MSR Check:** Wisdom functions as orientation ✔  
**BAC:** Wise ⇄ Aligned Interpreters ✔ Stars ⇄ Stable Authorities ✔

---

## Daniel 12:4

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| But thou, O Daniel, **shut up the words**, and **seal the book**, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased. | The pattern is **intentionally deferred**. Activity and data increase, but comprehension remains sealed until alignment occurs. |

**MSR Check:** Knowledge ≠ understanding ✔  
**BAC:** Seal ⇄ Deferred Comprehension ✔

---

## Daniel 12:5–7

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| …it shall be for a **time, times, and an half**; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished. | Disruption is **limited and measured**. Fragmentation exhausts itself before resolution completes. |

**MSR Check:** Disorder is bounded ✔  
**BAC:** Time/Times/Half ⇄ Limited Disruption ✔

---

## Daniel 12:8–9

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| …Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are **closed up and sealed** till the time of the end. | Understanding is withheld not by secrecy, but by unreadiness. |

**MSR Check:** Readiness governs revelation ✔  
**BAC:** Closed ⇄ Inaccessible Without Alignment ✔

---

## Daniel 12:10

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| Many shall be **purified**, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the **wise** shall understand. | Stress clarifies identity. Alignment increases perception; distortion blinds itself. |

**MSR Check:** Trials sort perception ✔  
**BAC:** Purified ⇄ Clarified Identity ✔

---

## Daniel 12:11–12

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| …from the time that the **daily sacrifice** shall be taken away, and the **abomination**… there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days… Blessed is he that **waiteth**… | When continuous alignment is replaced by distorted substitutes, endurance becomes the measure of blessing. |

**MSR Check:** Stability favors endurance ✔  
**BAC:** Daily Sacrifice ⇄ Continuous Alignment ✔ Wait ⇄ Endure ✔

---

## Daniel 12:13

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt **rest**, and stand in thy **lot** at the end of the days. | Maintain coherence. Identity resolves at its appointed integration point. |

**MSR Check:** Resolution is personal, not collective ✔  
**BAC:** Rest ⇄ Stabilized Identity ✔ Lot ⇄ Assigned Resolution ✔
