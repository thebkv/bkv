# Daniel 05 — Weighed Authority and the End of False Sovereignty
## Minimum Sufficient Role (MSR) + Verse-by-Verse Rendering (VBV)

---

## Architectural Function of Daniel 5 (Pre-Read)

Daniel 5 is **not** primarily about judgment, handwriting, or shock.  
It is the **moment when inherited authority is tested and found hollow**.

If Daniel 4 shows *authority humbled and restored*,  
Daniel 5 shows *authority inherited without humility and therefore removed*.

This chapter governs:
- misuse of sacred vessels
- intoxicated power
- interpretive blindness
- irreversible judgment
