## Daniel 8:1

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a **vision** appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. | In a later phase of declining authority, a **perceived inner pattern** appeared again to **conscious awareness**, following the earlier revealed structure. |

**MSR Check:** Vision = internal perception, not prediction ✔  
**BAC:** **Vision ⇄ Perceived Inner Pattern** ✔

---

## Daniel 8:2

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And I saw in a **vision**; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at **Shushan in the palace**, which is in the province of **Elam**; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of **Ulai**. | Awareness is positioned within a **seat of power**, in a realm of **enduring influence**, beside a **flowing channel of authority**. |

**MSR Check:** Geography = state of power, not location ✔  
**BAC:** **Palace ⇄ Seat of Power** ✔ **River ⇄ Flow of Authority** ✔

---

## Daniel 8:3

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a **ram** which had **two horns**: and the two horns were high; but one was **higher than the other**, and the higher came up last. | An **established power structure** stood within the authority stream, expressing **dual authority**, with one **later-emerging dominance** surpassing the other. |

**MSR Check:** Horns = authority expressions ✔  
**BAC:** **Ram ⇄ Established Power** ✔ **Horns ⇄ Authority Expressions** ✔

---

## Daniel 8:4

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| I saw the **ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward**; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great. | The power structure expands in all directions of influence, **unchecked**, acting entirely by **self-will**. |

**MSR Check:** Direction = total dominance ✔  
**BAC:** **Pushing ⇄ Expansion of Control** ✔

---

## Daniel 8:5

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And as I was considering, behold, an **he goat** came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and **touched not the ground**: and the goat had a **notable horn** between his eyes. | A **rapid, unrestrained force** emerges suddenly, operating without grounding, driven by a **centralized singular authority**. |

**MSR Check:** Speed = lack of restraint ✔  
**BAC:** **Goat ⇄ Unchecked Force** ✔ **Notable Horn ⇄ Centralized Authority** ✔

---

## Daniel 8:6–7

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And he came to the ram that had two horns… and ran unto him in the fury of his power… and cast him down… and stamped upon him… | The unchecked force violently **overthrows established authority**, annihilating balance through raw aggression. |

**MSR Check:** Conflict = replacement, not morality ✔  
**BAC:** **Stamped ⇄ Total Subjugation** ✔

---

## Daniel 8:8

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the **great horn was broken**; and for it came up **four notable ones** toward the four winds of heaven. | Singular dominance collapses, fragmenting into **multiple successor authorities**, dispersed across influence directions. |

**MSR Check:** Fragmentation follows unchecked centralization ✔  
**BAC:** **Broken Horn ⇄ Collapse of Singular Authority** ✔ **Four Horns ⇄ Fragmented Powers** ✔

---

## Daniel 8:9–12

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And out of one of them came forth a **little horn**, which waxed exceeding great… and it cast down some of the **host of heaven**… yea, he magnified himself even to the **prince of the host**, and by him the **daily sacrifice was taken away**, and the **place of his sanctuary was cast down**. | From fragmented authority arises a **self-exalting distortion** that attacks **ordered governing principles**, challenges **true authority**, removes **continual right alignment**, and desecrates **inner sacred order**. |

**MSR Check:** This is functional desecration, not theology ✔  
**BAC:** **Little Horn ⇄ Distorted Authority** ✔ **Daily Sacrifice ⇄ Continual Alignment** ✔ **Sanctuary ⇄ Inner Sacred Order** ✔

---

## Daniel 8:13–14

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| How long shall be the **vision**…? And he said… unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the **sanctuary be cleansed**. | The question concerns **duration of distortion**, answered with a **defined corrective interval**, culminating in **restoration of inner order**. |

**MSR Check:** Numbers = process duration, not calendar ✔  
**BAC:** **Cleansed Sanctuary ⇄ Restored Inner Order** ✔

---

## Daniel 8:15–17

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| …there stood before me as the appearance of a man… and he said, **Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision**. | An **interpretive messenger function** is activated to translate perception into understanding. |

**MSR Check:** Gabriel = interpretation, not character ✔  
**BAC:** **Gabriel ⇄ Interpretive Messenger Function** ✔

---

## Daniel 8:18–19

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a **deep sleep**… but he touched me… | Conscious awareness momentarily collapses under symbolic weight, then is **re-stabilized** for reception. |

**MSR Check:** Sleep = overload, not unconsciousness ✔  
**BAC:** **Sleep ⇄ Cognitive Overload** ✔

---

## Daniel 8:20–22

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| The **ram**… are the kings… The **rough goat** is the king… the **four kingdoms**… | The symbols are explicitly confirmed as **authority structures and successions**, not individuals. |

**MSR Check:** Text self-validates MSR ✔  
**BAC:** **Kings ⇄ Authority Structures** ✔

---

## Daniel 8:23–25

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| A king of fierce countenance… shall destroy wonderfully… stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be **broken without hand**. | Distorted authority ultimately **self-collapses**, undone by internal contradiction, not external force. |

**MSR Check:** Collapse is intrinsic ✔  
**BAC:** **Broken Without Hand ⇄ Internal Self-Destruction** ✔

---

## Daniel 8:26–27

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And the **vision**… is true… shut thou up the vision… And I Daniel fainted… but I rose up, and did the king’s business. | The pattern is **sealed for its time**, and awareness returns to **faithful function within present responsibility**. |

**MSR Check:** Integration without obsession ✔  
**BAC:** **Sealed ⇄ Deferred Activation** ✔
