- **Ancient of Days** → **Timeless Evaluative Authority**
- **Books** → **Records of Meaning / Truth Assessment**
- **Son of Man** → **True Human Authority Aligned with Heaven**
- **Clouds of Heaven** → **Authorized Perception, Not Mass Delusion**

## Daniel 7:1

| King James Version | VBV (Clarified Rendering) |
|---|---|
| In the first year of **Belshazzar king of Babylon** Daniel had a **dream and visions of his head upon his bed**: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters. | In the reign of **externalized authority**, Daniel receives **internal symbolic perception** while at rest; he records the **structural meaning** of what was shown. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Dream/vision = symbolic cognition ✔  
- Babylon = external authority system ✔  

**BAC:**  
**Belshazzar ⇄ Externalized Authority** ✔  
**Dream/Vision ⇄ Symbolic Perception** ✔

## Daniel 7:2–3

| King James Version | VBV |
|---|---|
| Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the **four winds of the heaven** strove upon the **great sea**. And **four great beasts** came up from the sea, diverse one from another. | Competing **ideological forces** agitate the **collective unconscious**, producing **four distinct authority systems**, each unlike the others. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Winds act on sea (forces → population field) ✔  
- Beasts emerge, not descend ✔  

**BAC:**  
**Winds ⇄ Ideological Forces** ✔  
**Sea ⇄ Collective Field** ✔  
**Beasts ⇄ Authority Systems** ✔  

---

## Daniel 7:4–6 (Condensed Unit)

| King James Version | VBV |
|---|---|
| The first was like a **lion**, the second like a **bear**, the third like a **leopard**… | Successive authority systems increase in **speed, reach, and abstraction**, trading nobility for efficiency and control. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Animals represent *how* authority operates, not nations ✔  
- Progression is qualitative, not chronological only ✔  

**BAC:**  
**Lion/Bear/Leopard ⇄ Modes of Authority** ✔

## Daniel 7:7–8

| King James Version | VBV |
|---|---|
| …a **fourth beast**, dreadful and terrible… and it had **ten horns**… and behold, there came up among them another **little horn**… speaking great things. | A **totalizing system of power** arises, subdivided into **multiple authority expressions**, from which emerges a **self-exalting interpretive authority** claiming superiority. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Little horn = interpretive, not military ✔  
- Speech is its defining action ✔  

**BAC:**  
**Fourth Beast ⇄ Totalizing System** ✔  
**Horns ⇄ Power Expressions** ✔  
**Little Horn ⇄ Self-Exalting Authority** ✔  

---

## Daniel 7:9–10

| King James Version | VBV |
|---|---|
| I beheld till the **thrones were cast down**, and the **Ancient of days** did sit… and the **books were opened**. | All provisional authorities are suspended as **timeless evaluative authority** assumes judgment; **records of meaning** are examined. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Thrones removed before judgment ✔  
- Books precede outcome ✔  

**BAC:**  
**Ancient of Days ⇄ Timeless Authority** ✔  
**Books ⇄ Records of Meaning** ✔  

---

## Daniel 7:11–12

| King James Version | VBV |
|---|---|
| I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake… | Self-exalting authority collapses under **exposure**, while other systems persist briefly in reduced form. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Speech triggers judgment ✔  
- Systems may linger without authority ✔  

**BAC:**  
**Great Words ⇄ Self-Exalting Claims** ✔  

---

## Daniel 7:13–14

| King James Version | VBV |
|---|---|
| …one like the **Son of man** came with the **clouds of heaven**… and there was given him **dominion**… | **True human authority**, aligned with higher perception, is granted **enduring dominion** not subject to decay or replacement. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Son of Man contrasts beasts ✔  
- Authority is received, not seized ✔  

**BAC:**  
**Son of Man ⇄ True Human Authority** ✔  
**Clouds ⇄ Authorized Perception** ✔  
**Dominion ⇄ Enduring Order** ✔  

---

## Daniel 7:15–18

| King James Version | VBV |
|---|---|
| These great beasts… are four kings… but the **saints of the most High** shall take the kingdom… | Authority systems are temporary, but **aligned identity communities** inherit lasting order. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Saints are collective, not elite ✔  
- Kingdom is participatory ✔  

**BAC:**  
**Saints ⇄ Aligned Identity Community** ✔  

---

## Daniel 7:19–27 (Final Synthesis)

| King James Version | VBV |
|---|---|
| …the horn made war with the saints… until the **Ancient of days** came… | Self-exalting authority oppresses alignment until **timeless judgment** intervenes, transferring authority permanently to the aligned. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Conflict is interpretive and systemic ✔  
- Resolution is structural, not cyclical ✔  

**BAC:**  
**War ⇄ Suppression of Alignment** ✔  
**Judgment ⇄ Structural Transfer of Authority** ✔  

---

## Editor’s MSR Verdict — Daniel 7

- Beasts = authority systems, not merely empires ✔  
- Son of Man = restored human authority ✔  
- Judgment precedes kingdom ✔  
- Books are evaluative, not punitive ✔  

**MSR Status:** Stable, Canon-Compatible, Non-Inflated
