## Chapter Status (Daniel 9)

- **MSR-Passed (Whole Chapter)**
- Time treated as **structural sequence**, not calendar math
- Delay framed as **protective maturation**, not failure
- Restoration governed by **phased coherence**, not haste

### Transitional Note
Daniel 9 establishes that **prophetic time is measured by readiness**, not urgency. Restoration unfolds only as alignment can sustain it.
