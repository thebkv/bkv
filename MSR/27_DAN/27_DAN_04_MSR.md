| Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. | The **dominant ruling identity** addresses all internal systems and expressions within lived experience, declaring stability and order. |
| I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me. | The ruling self recognizes that transformation has been **done to it**, not produced by it. |
| How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation. | Ultimate authority is acknowledged as **transcendent, continuous, and superior** to personal power cycles. |
