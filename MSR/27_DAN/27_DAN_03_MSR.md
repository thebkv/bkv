## Daniel 3:1

**KJV**  
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an **image of gold**, whose height was threescore cubits… and set it up in the **plain of Dura**, in the province of Babylon.

**MSR Check:**  
- Sentence role: establishment of false unity ✔  
- Image = identity object, not idol theory ✔  

**BAC:**  
**Image of Gold ⇄ Manufactured Identity** ✔  
**Plain of Dura ⇄ System of Conformity** ✔

---

## Daniel 3:24–25

**KJV**

> What cannot be burned cannot be ruled.
