## Daniel 6:1–3

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| It pleased **Darius** to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty **princes**… and over these three **presidents**; of whom **Daniel** was first… because an **excellent spirit** was in him. | **Administrative authority** organizes the system through multiple **governing subsystems**, among which **integrated faithful consciousness** is distinguished, because an **unfractured inner coherence** operates within it. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Sentence role: establishment of hierarchy and identification of a stabilizing center ✔  
- Daniel’s distinction is *internal quality*, not ambition ✔  

**BAC:**  
- **Darius ⇄ Administrative Authority** ✔  
- **Princes/Presidents ⇄ Governing Subsystems** ✔  
- **Daniel ⇄ Integrated Faithful Consciousness** ✔  
- **Excellent Spirit ⇄ Inner Coherence** ✔

## Daniel 6:4–5

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| Then the **presidents and princes** sought to find occasion against **Daniel**… but they could find none… except they find it against him concerning the **law of his God**. | The **competing subsystems** attempt to destabilize **faithful consciousness**, but no internal fault is found; only its **alignment with Source-law** creates vulnerability within the system. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Conflict arises not from failure, but from faithfulness ✔  
- Pressure targets alignment, not behavior ✔  

**BAC:**  
- **Presidents/Princes ⇄ Competing Subsystems** ✔  
- **Law of his God ⇄ Alignment with Source-law** ✔  

---

## Daniel 6:6–9

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| Establish a **royal statute**, and make a firm **decree**, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee… shall be cast into the **den of lions**. | The system institutes a **fixed external constraint**, forbidding **direct alignment with Source**, enforcing compliance through threat of **predatory systemic consequence**. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Law is designed to interrupt alignment ✔  
- The issue is *exclusive authority* ✔  

**BAC:**  
- **Statute/Decree ⇄ Fixed External Constraint** ✔  
- **Den of Lions ⇄ Predatory Systemic Pressure** ✔  

---

## Daniel 6:10

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| **Daniel**, when he knew that the writing was signed… **prayed**, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime. | **Faithful consciousness**, fully aware of the constraint, continues **alignment with Source** without alteration or concealment. |

**MSR Check:**  
- No rebellion, no dramatics — continuity of alignment ✔  
- Faithfulness is consistency, not reaction ✔  

**BAC:**  
- **Daniel ⇄ Faithful Consciousness** ✔  
- **Prayed ⇄ Alignment with Source** ✔

## Daniel 6:11–13

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| Then these men assembled, and found **Daniel praying**… and they spake before the king concerning the **king’s decree**. | The **competing subsystems** expose the act of **alignment**, invoking the **external constraint** to force judgment. |

**MSR Check:**  
- The system polices alignment ✔  
- Truth is used as accusation ✔  

**BAC:**  
- **Praying ⇄ Alignment** ✔  
- **Decree ⇄ External Constraint** ✔

## Daniel 6:14–16

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| Then the **king**, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself… and the king commanded, and they brought **Daniel**, and cast him into the **den of lions**. | **Administrative authority**, conflicted by its own structure, permits **faithful consciousness** to be subjected to **systemic predation** it cannot reverse. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Authority is trapped by its own law ✔  
- Goodwill cannot override structure ✔  

**BAC:**  
- **King ⇄ Administrative Authority** ✔  
- **Den of Lions ⇄ Systemic Predation** ✔  

---

## Daniel 6:17

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And a **stone** was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own **signet**… | The consequence is **sealed**, rendered **irreversible by authority**, removing human intervention. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Closure is total ✔  
- No appeal remains ✔  

**BAC:**  
- **Stone ⇄ Irrevocable Closure** ✔  
- **Seal/Signet ⇄ Authoritative Finality** ✔  

---

## Daniel 6:18–20

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| Then the king went to his palace… and in the morning… cried with a lamentable voice… | Authority enters **restless anxiety**, uncertain whether integrity can survive structural violence. |

|---|---|
| My God hath sent his **angel**, and hath shut the **lions’ mouths**… because before him innocency was found in me. | A **protective regulatory function** neutralizes the **consuming forces**, preserving integrity because no internal fracture exists. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Protection comes from coherence, not rescue ✔  
- Lions are restrained, not destroyed ✔  

**BAC:**  
- **Angel ⇄ Protective Regulatory Function** ✔  
- **Lions ⇄ Consuming Forces** ✔  

---

## Daniel 6:24

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|

---

## Daniel 6:28
