## Daniel 2:1–13 — Authority Demands Origin, Not Technique

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And in the second year of the reign of **Nebuchadnezzar** **Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams**, wherewith his spirit was troubled… | In the maturity of **central authority**, an **unconscious revelation** arises that disturbs stability and demands meaning. |
| Then the king commanded to call the **magicians**, and the **astrologers**, and the **sorcerers**, and the **Chaldeans**… | **Technical interpretive systems** are summoned to explain what originates beyond technique. |
| …the king said, **Tell me the dream**, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation… | Authority requires **source-knowledge**, not post-hoc explanation. |
| …the Chaldeans answered… **There is not a man upon the earth** that can shew the king’s matter… | Technique admits its limit when cut off from origin. |
| …the king was angry… and commanded to destroy all the **wise men** of Babylon. | Authority collapses interpretive systems that cannot reach origin. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Sentence Role: Authority tests whether interpretation arises from **origin** or **method** ✔  
- Minimum Sufficiency: Failure is systemic, not moral ✔  
**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Stable)

**BAC:**  
- **King ⇄ Central Governing Authority** ✔  
- **Dream ⇄ Unconscious Revelation** ✔  
- **Wise Men ⇄ Technical Interpretive Systems** ✔

## Daniel 2:14–23 — Revelation Given to Integrative Awareness

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| Then **Daniel** answered with counsel and wisdom… | **Integrative awareness** responds without panic, seeking source rather than survival. |
| …that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation. | Faithful awareness requests **alignment time**, not technique time. |
| Then was the secret revealed unto **Daniel in a night vision**. | **Revelation arrives in receptive stillness**, not striving. |
| Blessed be the name of God… he **changeth the times and the seasons**… | Source governs **cycles**, not systems. |
| He **giveth wisdom unto the wise**, and **knowledge** to them that know understanding. | Interpretive capacity flows from alignment, not credential. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Sentence Role: Source responds to humility and alignment ✔  
- Continuity: Sets interpretive authority pattern for the book ✔  
**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Stable)

**BAC:**  
- **Daniel ⇄ Integrative Awareness** ✔  
- **Night Vision ⇄ Receptive Revelation** ✔  
- **Times/Seasons ⇄ Governed Cycles** ✔  
- **Wisdom/Knowledge ⇄ Interpretive Capacity** ✔

## Daniel 2:24–35 — The Composite Image Revealed

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| …**Daniel** went in unto **Arioch**… destroy not the **wise men** of Babylon… | Integrative awareness preserves systems by reconnecting them to source. |
| Thou, O king, **sawest**, and behold a **great image**… | Authority beholds a **composite structure** of delegated power. |
| This image’s **head was of fine gold**, his **breast and arms of silver**, his **belly and thighs of brass**, his **legs of iron**, his **feet part of iron and part of clay**. | Authority descends from **pure origin** to **mixed dependency**, losing integrity at each layer. |
| …a **stone cut out without hands**… smote the image upon his feet… | **Non-derived authority** strikes at the weakest composite point. |
| …the stone… became a **great mountain**, and filled the whole earth. | True authority **establishes enduring dominion**. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Sentence Role: Vision maps authority integrity, not history ✔  
- Minimum Sufficiency: Materials denote **authority quality**, not chronology ✔  
**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Stable)

**BAC:**  
- **Image ⇄ Composite Authority Structure** ✔  
- **Gold/Silver/Brass/Iron/Clay ⇄ Descending Integrity** ✔  
- **Stone ⇄ Non-derived Authority** ✔  
- **Mountain ⇄ Established Dominion** ✔

## Daniel 2:36–45 — Interpretation Anchored in Source

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| Thou art this **head of gold**… | Present authority reflects **origin-derived integrity**. |
| …another kingdom inferior to thee… | Subsequent authority operates at **reduced coherence**. |
| …the **God of heaven** shall set up a kingdom… which shall not be left to other people… | Source establishes **non-transferable authority**. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Sentence Role: Interpretation remains symbolic-functional ✔  
- Continuity: Prepares later visions (ch. 7–12) ✔  
**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Stable)

**BAC:**  
- **Head of Gold ⇄ Origin Integrity** ✔  
- **God of Heaven ⇄ Source Authority** ✔

## Daniel 2:46–49 — Authority Recognizes Source

| King James Version | VBV (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| Then the king **fell upon his face**… | Central authority **acknowledges source**. |
| …Of a truth it is, that your **God is a God of gods**… | Authority confesses **hierarchy of origin**. |
| Then the king made **Daniel a great man**… | Integrative awareness is entrusted with governance. |

**MSR Check:**  
- Sentence Role: Authority yields without annihilation ✔  
**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Stable)

**BAC:**  
- **Worship ⇄ Acknowledgment of Source** ✔  
- **Promotion ⇄ Entrusted Governance** ✔
