# Revelation 17–18 (Paired Chapter)
## The Collapse of False Union and the Fall of the World-System

### *(Paired intentionally — the traditional chapter break does not appear structurally inspired)*

Editorial Note (BKV):
Revelation chapters 17 and 18 are treated here as a single symbolic unit. The traditional chapter division appears to interrupt a continuous inner operation and does not reflect a meaningful structural break in the text.

### Method: **Minimum Sufficient Role (MSR)** with **Bold Audit Check (BAC)**
