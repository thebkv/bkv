# Matthew 02 — Authority Threatened, Guidance Obeyed
## MSR Architectural Reading

---

## MSR Preface (Matthew-Specific)

Matthew 02 is not a travelogue or political history.

Under **Minimum Sufficient Role (MSR)**, this chapter describes what happens
**when emerging divine authority enters a system that already believes it owns authority**.

The chapter contrasts:
- authentic guidance vs. threatened power
- obedience vs. calculation
- preservation vs. domination

Every figure appears only to perform a role in this conflict.

## Matthew 2:1–2

| King James Version | MSR Rendering |
|---|---|
| Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. | **Emerging divine authority** appears quietly in a **humble origin**, while **external discernment** follows **authentic guidance** toward recognition of true authority. |

**MSR Check**
- Function: introduction of authority + recognition ✔
- Bethlehem required (humble emergence) ✔
- Star required (guidance, not coercion) ✔

**BAC**
- **Child ⇄ Emerging Authority** ✔  
- **Wise Men ⇄ Discernment** ✔  
- **Star ⇄ Revelation** ✔

## Matthew 2:19–21

**MSR Check**
- Nazareth required (non-prestigious formation) ✔
- Avoidance of Archelaus preserves continuity ✔

**BAC**
- **Nazareth ⇄ Non-Prestigious Formation** ✔

## MSR Integrity Statement (Matthew 02)

Matthew 02 teaches:

- True authority does not announce itself.
- False authority panics when exposed.
- Guidance is followed, not argued.
- Preservation precedes confrontation.
- Obscurity protects maturation.

Nothing more is required for the chapter to function.
Nothing less explains its coherence.
