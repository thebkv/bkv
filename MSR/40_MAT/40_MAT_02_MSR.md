# Matthew 02 — Authority Threatened, Guidance Obeyed
## MSR Architectural Reading

---

## MSR Preface (Matthew-Specific)

The conventional reading of Matthew 02 emphasizes  
political danger, prophetic fulfillment, and miraculous preservation.

Under **Minimum Sufficient Role (MSR)**, this chapter reveals **what happens when emerging divine authority enters a system that already assumes it owns authority**.

The chapter functions as a contrast between:
- threatened power vs. authentic authority  
- calculation vs. obedience  
- domination vs. preservation  

Every figure appears only to perform a role within this conflict.  
Nothing in the chapter requires symbolic inflation beyond that function.

| Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him. | **Emerging divine authority** appears quietly in a **humble origin**, while **external discernment** follows **authentic guidance** toward recognition of true authority. |

## MSR Integrity Statement (Matthew 02)

Matthew 02 shows that:

- True authority does not announce itself.
- False authority panics when exposed.
- Guidance is followed, not argued.
- Preservation precedes confrontation.
- Obscurity protects maturation.

Nothing more is required for the chapter to function.  
Nothing less explains its coherence.
