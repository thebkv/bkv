# Matthew 05 — Authority Re-Defined from the Inside
## MSR Architectural Reading

---

## MSR Preface (Matthew-Specific)

**Conventional reading:**  
Matthew 05 is commonly read as a moral teaching, an ethical upgrade, or a higher law replacing an older one.

**MSR reading:**  
Under **Minimum Sufficient Role (MSR)**, Matthew 05 functions as a **redefinition of authority itself**.  
Jesus is not issuing improved rules; he is relocating where authority operates.

The chapter explains:
- why external compliance fails
- why internal alignment precedes righteous action
- how authority moves from behavior to orientation

Nothing here abolishes the Law.  
Nothing here relaxes discipline.  
Everything here moves authority **inward**, to the level of intent, perception, and alignment.

## MSR Integrity Statement (Matthew 05)

Matthew 05 teaches that:

- Authority is internal before it is external.
- Alignment precedes obedience.
- Behavior reveals orientation.
- Law functions only when intent is ordered.
- Divine authority produces wholeness, not performance.

Nothing more is required for the chapter to function.  
Nothing less explains why obedience alone fails.
