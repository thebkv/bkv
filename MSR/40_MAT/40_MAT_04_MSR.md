# Matthew 04 — Authority Tested, Orientation Secured
## MSR Architectural Reading

---

## MSR Preface (Matthew-Specific)

The conventional reading of Matthew 04 understands this chapter as
a moral test of Jesus’ virtue, a dramatic confrontation with evil,
and the beginning of public ministry.

Under **Minimum Sufficient Role (MSR)**, Matthew 04 functions as the
**orientation trial of legitimate authority**.

This chapter answers a single structural question:

> *Can emerging divine authority remain aligned with Source when power,
identity, and influence are offered prematurely?*

The temptations are not about sin in general.
They are **tests of misaligned shortcuts to authority**.

Only after orientation is secured does outward ministry begin.

## Matthew 4:1–2

| King James Version | MSR Rendering |
|---|---|
| Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. | **Aligned authority** is intentionally directed by **Source guidance** into a **testing environment**, entering a state of **complete dependence** prior to confrontation. |

**MSR Check**
- Testing is initiated by Spirit, not opposition ✔
- Hunger establishes legitimate vulnerability ✔

**BAC**
- **Spirit ⇄ Source Guidance** ✔  
- **Wilderness ⇄ Testing Environment** ✔  
- **Hunger ⇄ Dependency Exposure** ✔

## Matthew 4:3–4

| King James Version | MSR Rendering |
|---|---|
| And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread… | **Misaligned authority** challenges identity and offers **material self-sufficiency** as a substitute for **continued trust in Source**. |

**MSR Check**
- Identity challenge precedes action ✔
- Shortcut offered is legitimate need, wrongly sourced ✔

**BAC**
- **Tempter ⇄ Misaligned Authority** ✔  
- **Stones to Bread ⇄ Material Control** ✔  
- **Word of God ⇄ Sustaining Alignment** ✔

## Matthew 4:5–7

| King James Version | MSR Rendering |
|---|---|
| Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple… | **Misaligned authority** attempts to provoke **spectacle-based validation**, testing whether alignment will be replaced by **public proof**. |

**MSR Check**
- Temple = religious authority center ✔
- Scripture misuse signals distortion ✔

**BAC**
- **Temple Pinnacle ⇄ Spectacle Validation** ✔  
- **Casting Down ⇄ Forced Proof** ✔

## Matthew 4:8–10

| King James Version | MSR Rendering |
|---|---|
| Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world… | **Premature global authority** is offered without obedience, proposing **rule without alignment** and **outcome without process**. |

**MSR Check**
- This is the core authority shortcut ✔
- Rejection must be absolute ✔

**BAC**
- **Kingdoms ⇄ Delegated Power** ✔  
- **Worship ⇄ Ultimate Alignment** ✔

---

## Matthew 4:11

| King James Version | MSR Rendering |
|---|---|
| Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him. | Once **alignment is fully secured**, **misaligned authority withdraws**, and **support follows naturally**, not coercively. |

**MSR Check**
- Support follows obedience, not demand ✔

**BAC**
- **Angels ⇄ Post-Alignment Support** ✔

## Matthew 4:12–17

| King James Version | MSR Rendering |
|---|---|
| Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison… From that time Jesus began to preach… | With **orientation secured** and **forerunner removed**, **public authority begins**, emerging from **non-central regions** and announcing **repentant reorientation**. |

**MSR Check**
- Ministry begins only after testing ✔
- Galilee preserves humility ✔

**BAC**
- **Galilee ⇄ Non-Central Formation** ✔  
- **Repent ⇄ Reorientation** ✔

## Matthew 4:18–22

| King James Version | MSR Rendering |
|---|---|
| And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren… | **Aligned authority** calls **responsive faculties** directly, requiring **immediate release of prior identity structures**. |

**MSR Check**
- Call precedes instruction ✔
- Leaving nets = releasing livelihood identity ✔

**BAC**
- **Fishers ⇄ Operative Faculties** ✔  
- **Nets ⇄ Prior Identity Structures** ✔

## Matthew 4:23–25

| King James Version | MSR Rendering |
|---|---|
| And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching… and healing all manner of sickness… | **Aligned authority**, now stable, expresses itself through **instruction, restoration, and coherence**, drawing attention without manipulation. |

**MSR Check**
- Works follow alignment, not precede it ✔

**BAC**
- **Healing ⇄ Restored Order** ✔  
- **Teaching ⇄ Structural Truth** ✔

## MSR Integrity Statement (Matthew 04)

Matthew 04 teaches:

- Authority must be tested before it is trusted.
- Shortcuts always target legitimate needs.
- Alignment precedes influence.
- Support follows obedience, not demand.
- Public ministry begins only after orientation is secured.

Nothing more is required for the chapter to function.
Nothing less explains its coherence.
