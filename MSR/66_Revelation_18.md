# Revelation 17–18 (Paired Chapter)

##The Collapse of False Union and the Fall of the World-System

(Paired intentionally — the traditional chapter break does not appear structurally inspired)

Editorial Note (BKV): Revelation chapters 17 and 18 are treated here as a single symbolic unit. The traditional chapter division appears to interrupt a continuous inner operation and does not reflect a meaningful structural break in the text.
