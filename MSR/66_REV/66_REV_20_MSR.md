## Revelation 20:1

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And I saw an **angel** come down from heaven, having the **key of the bottomless pit** and a great **chain** in his hand. | I perceived a **regulatory function** descending from higher order, holding **authority over unconscious containment** and a decisive **constraint**. |

**MSR Check:** Authority introduced specifically to restrain distortion ✔  
**BAC:** **Angel ⇄ Regulatory Function** ✔ **Key ⇄ Authority** ✔ **Bottomless Pit ⇄ Unconscious Containment** ✔ **Chain ⇄ Constraint** ✔

## Revelation 20:2

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And he laid hold on the **dragon**, that **old serpent**, which is the **Devil**, and **Satan**, and bound him a **thousand years**, | The **distorted authority pattern**—the **deceptive instinct**, the **accusatory voice**—is **restricted** for a **complete stabilization interval**. |

**MSR Check:** Multiple names identify one function ✔  
**BAC:** **Dragon/Serpent/Devil/Satan ⇄ Distorted Authority** ✔ **Thousand Years ⇄ Stabilization Interval** ✔

---

## Revelation 20:3

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And cast him into the **bottomless pit**, and shut him up, and set a **seal** upon him, that he should **deceive the nations no more**, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season. | The pattern is **contained in unconscious suspension**, **secured**, unable to **mislead organizing systems**, until stabilization completes; afterward it is briefly **released for testing**. |

**MSR Check:** Containment is purposeful, not permanent ✔  
**BAC:** **Bottomless Pit ⇄ Unconscious Containment** ✔ **Seal ⇄ Secured Containment** ✔ **Deceive ⇄ Mislead Systems** ✔ **Loosed ⇄ Tested** ✔

## Revelation 20:4

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And I saw **thrones**, and they sat upon them, and **judgment** was given unto them: and I saw the **souls** of them that were **beheaded** for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast… and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. | I perceived **governing frameworks**, entrusted with **discernment**, and **living identities** that had **removed false authority** for **experienced truth**; these operate with **restored authority** throughout stabilization. |

**MSR Check:** Authority belongs to those who relinquished ego-rule ✔  
**BAC:** **Thrones ⇄ Governing Frameworks** ✔ **Judgment ⇄ Discernment** ✔ **Souls ⇄ Living Identities** ✔ **Beheaded ⇄ False Authority Removed** ✔

## Revelation 20:5

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |

## Revelation 20:6

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| **Blessed and holy** is he that hath part in the **first resurrection**: on such the **second death** hath no power, but they shall be **priests of God and of Christ**, and shall reign with him a thousand years. | **Aligned and integrated** are those awakened to authority; **loss of coherence** has no hold on them. They function as **mediators of truth** and **governing presence** throughout stabilization. |

**MSR Check:** Authority protects identity coherence ✔  
**BAC:** **Blessed ⇄ Aligned** ✔ **Holy ⇄ Integrated** ✔ **Second Death ⇄ Loss of Coherence** ✔ **Priests ⇄ Mediators** ✔ **Reign ⇄ Govern** ✔

|---|---|
| And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the **camp of the saints**, and the **beloved city**: and **fire came down from God** out of heaven, and devoured them. | Resistance surrounds **aligned identity** and **inner peace**, but **truth-energy** descends from **Source Awareness** and dissolves the distortion. |
