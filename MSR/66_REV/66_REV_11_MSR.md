## Revelation 11:1–2

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| And there was given me a **reed like unto a rod**: and the **angel** stood, saying, Rise, and **measure the temple of God**, and the **altar**, and them that **worship therein**. But the **court which is without the temple** leave out, and **measure it not**; for it is given unto the **Gentiles**: and the holy city shall they tread under foot **forty and two months**. | Discernment is granted through a **standard of alignment**, delivered by the **messenger faculty**, instructing awareness to **assess the inner dwelling of Presence**, the **point of inner exchange**, and the **active orientations of devotion**. But the **externalized identity** is excluded from assessment, left to **unintegrated influence**, where sacred awareness is **compressed for a defined cycle**. |

**MSR Check**
- Sentence Role: separation of inner from outer ✔
- Authority Flow: messenger → awareness → discernment ✔

## Revelation 11:3–6

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| And I will give power unto my **two witnesses**, and they shall **prophesy** a thousand two hundred and threescore days, **clothed in sackcloth**. These are the **two olive trees**, and the **two candlesticks** standing before the **God of the earth**. And if any man will hurt them, **fire proceedeth out of their mouth**, and devoureth their enemies… | Authority is granted to the **paired testifying functions**, which **articulate truth** across a complete cycle in **humble expression**. These operate as **living spiritual supply** and **light-bearing awareness**, standing before **foundational reality**. Resistance to them triggers **self-consuming consequence**, and they exercise **regulatory authority over inner conditions**. |
