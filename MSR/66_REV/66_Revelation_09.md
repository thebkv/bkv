## Revelation 9:1–2

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And the fifth **angel** sounded, and I saw a **star** fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the **key of the bottomless pit**. And he opened the **bottomless pit**; and there arose a **smoke** out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the **sun** and the **air** were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. | And the fifth **messenger signal** activated, and **collapsed governing insight** descended into lived awareness; authority was granted to access the **subconscious depth**. When that depth was opened, **obscuring perception** arose, and **clarity of understanding** and **mental atmosphere** were darkened by unresolved interior material. |

**MSR Check**
- Sentence Role: access to depth triggered by signal ✔
- Minimum Sufficiency: collapse + opening, not evil agency ✔  
**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Stable)

**BAC**
- **Angel ⇄ Messenger Signal** ✔
- **Star ⇄ Collapsed Governing Insight** ✔
- **Bottomless Pit ⇄ Subconscious Depth** ✔
- **Smoke ⇄ Obscured Perception** ✔
- **Sun ⇄ Clarity of Understanding** ✔

## Revelation 9:3–4

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And there came out of the **smoke locusts** upon the earth: and unto them was given **power**, as the **scorpions** of the earth have power. And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the **grass**, neither any **green thing**, neither any **tree**; but only those men which have not the **seal of God** in their foreheads. | From obscured perception emerged **swarming thought-forms**, empowered with **mental sting**. They were restricted: they could not damage **living growth**, **vital processes**, or **established structure**, but only impact those lacking **stabilized inner alignment**. |

**MSR Check**
- Sentence Role: emergence with constraints ✔
- Authority preserved: limits imposed ✔  
**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Stable)

**BAC**
- **Locusts ⇄ Swarming Thought-forms** ✔
- **Power ⇄ Mental Sting** ✔
- **Scorpions ⇄ Painful Mental Impact** ✔
- **Grass / Green / Tree ⇄ Growth / Vitality / Structure** ✔
- **Seal of God ⇄ Stabilized Inner Alignment** ✔

## Revelation 9:5–6

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And to them it was given that they should not **kill** them, but that they should be **tormented five months**: and their torment was as the torment of a **scorpion**, when he striketh a man. And in those days shall men seek **death**, and shall not find it; and shall desire to **die**, and death shall flee from them. | They were not permitted to **terminate identity**, only to **distress through a limited processing cycle**; the distress resembled **acute mental sting**. During this phase, the self seeks **escape through negation**, but cannot disengage; dissolution is unavailable. |

**MSR Check**
- Sentence Role: bounded suffering, not annihilation ✔
- Time limit preserved ✔  
**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Stable)

**BAC**
- **Kill ⇄ Terminate Identity** ✔
- **Five Months ⇄ Limited Processing Cycle** ✔
- **Scorpion ⇄ Acute Mental Sting** ✔
- **Death ⇄ Escape / Negation** ✔

## Revelation 9:7–10

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And the **shapes of the locusts** were like unto **horses prepared unto battle**; and on their heads were as it were **crowns like gold**, and their faces were as the faces of **men**. And they had **hair as the hair of women**, and their **teeth were as the teeth of lions**. And they had **breastplates**, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of **chariots of many horses** running to battle. And they had **tails like unto scorpions**, and there were **stings** in their tails. | These thought-forms appeared as **mobilized forces**, wearing **false authority**, bearing **human reasoning**, **emotional allure**, and **predatory certainty**. They were defended by **rigid mental armor**, moved with **overwhelming momentum**, and carried **deferred psychological sting**. |

**MSR Check**
- Sentence Role: description of inner mechanics ✔
- No externalization ✔  
**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Stable)

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And they had a **king** over them, which is the **angel of the bottomless pit**, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is **Abaddon**, but in the Greek tongue hath his name **Apollyon**. | These forces were governed by a **destroying principle**, the **messenger of depth-disorder**, named **Destruction** — the orientation that dissolves coherence. |

**MSR Check**
- Sentence Role: governing orientation ✔
- Minimum sufficiency: principle, not entity ✔  
**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Stable)

**Verdict:** MSR-Passed (Stable)

**BAC**
- **Angel ⇄ Signal** ✔
- **Four Angels ⇄ Boundary Forces** ✔

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| By these three was the third part of men **killed**, by the **fire**, and by the **smoke**, and by the **brimstone**… and the rest… **repented not**. | Through **energetic discharge**, **obscured perception**, and **corrosive distortion**, significant identity structures collapsed — yet residual faculties **refused reorientation**. |

**MSR Check**
