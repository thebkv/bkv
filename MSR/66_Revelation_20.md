## Revelation 20:1

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And I saw an **angel** come down from heaven, having the **key of the bottomless pit** and a great **chain** in his hand. | I perceived a **regulatory function** descending from higher order, holding **authority over unconscious containment** and a decisive **constraint**. |

**MSR Check:** Binding authority introduced to limit distortion ✔  
**BAC:** **Angel ⇄ Regulatory Function** ✔ **Key ⇄ Authority** ✔ **Bottomless Pit ⇄ Unconscious Containment** ✔ **Chain ⇄ Constraint** ✔

---

## Revelation 20:2

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And he laid hold on the **dragon**, that **old serpent**, which is the **Devil**, and **Satan**, and bound him a **thousand years**. | The **distorted authority pattern**—the **deceptive instinct** and **accusatory voice**—is **restricted** for a **complete stabilization interval**. |

**MSR Check:** Multiple names, one functional role ✔  
**BAC:** **Dragon / Serpent / Devil / Satan ⇄ Distorted Authority** ✔ **Thousand Years ⇄ Stabilization Interval** ✔

---

## Revelation 20:3

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And cast him into the **bottomless pit**, and shut him up, and set a **seal** upon him, that he should **deceive the nations no more**, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season. | The pattern is **contained in unconscious suspension**, **secured**, unable to **mislead organizing systems**, until stabilization completes; afterward it is briefly **released for testing**. |

**MSR Check:** Containment is purposeful and temporary ✔  
**BAC:** **Seal ⇄ Secured Containment** ✔ **Deceive ⇄ Mislead Systems** ✔ **Loosed ⇄ Testing Release** ✔

---

## Revelation 20:4

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And I saw **thrones**, and they sat upon them, and **judgment** was given unto them: and I saw the **souls** of them that were **beheaded** for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God… | I perceived **governing frameworks** entrusted with **discernment**, and **living identities** that had **removed false authority** for the sake of **experienced truth**; these operate with restored authority. |

**MSR Check:** Authority follows surrender of ego-rule ✔  
**BAC:** **Thrones ⇄ Governing Frameworks** ✔ **Judgment ⇄ Discernment** ✔ **Souls ⇄ Living Identities** ✔ **Beheaded ⇄ Ego Authority Removed** ✔

---

## Revelation 20:5

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| But the rest of the **dead** lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the **first resurrection**. | Other identity structures remain **inactive** until stabilization completes. This awakening is the **first realization of true authority**. |

**MSR Check:** Resurrection = awakening, not animation ✔  
**BAC:** **Dead ⇄ Inactive Identity** ✔ **First Resurrection ⇄ Initial Awakening** ✔

---

## Revelation 20:6

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| **Blessed and holy** is he that hath part in the **first resurrection**: on such the **second death** hath no power, but they shall be **priests of God and of Christ**, and shall reign with him a thousand years. | **Aligned and integrated** are those awakened to authority; **loss of coherence** has no hold on them. They function as **mediators of truth** and **governing presence** throughout stabilization. |

**MSR Check:** Alignment protects against collapse ✔  
**BAC:** **Blessed ⇄ Aligned** ✔ **Holy ⇄ Integrated** ✔ **Second Death ⇄ Loss of Coherence** ✔ **Priests ⇄ Mediators** ✔ **Reign ⇄ Govern** ✔

---

## Revelation 20:7

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And **when the thousand years** are expired, **Satan** shall be loosed out of his **prison**. | After stabilization, the **accusatory pattern** is **released from containment**. |

**BAC:** **Satan ⇄ Accusatory Pattern** ✔ **Prison ⇄ Containment** ✔

---

## Revelation 20:8

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And shall go out to **deceive the nations**… **Gog and Magog**… to **battle**. | It attempts again to **mislead organizing systems**, mobilizing **externalized resistance patterns** toward **conflict**. |

**MSR Check:** Deception targets systems, not essence ✔  
**BAC:** **Nations ⇄ Organizing Systems** ✔ **Gog and Magog ⇄ Resistance Patterns** ✔ **Battle ⇄ Conflict** ✔

---

## Revelation 20:9

| King James Version | Bible Key Version (Symbolic) |
|---|---|
| And they compassed the **camp of the saints**, and the **beloved city**: and **fire came down from God**… | Distortion surrounds **aligned identity** and **inner peace**, but **truth-energy** descends from **Source** and dissolves it. |

**MSR Check:** Truth resolves conflict immediately ✔
