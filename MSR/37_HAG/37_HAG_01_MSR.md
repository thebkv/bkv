# Haggai 01 — Misplaced Priority and Stalled Alignment
## Minimum Sufficient Role (MSR) Reading

---

## MSR Preface (Haggai-Specific)

Haggai is not about temple construction as an architectural project.

Under **Minimum Sufficient Role (MSR)**, Haggai 01 functions as a **priority alignment audit**:
it diagnoses why effort increases while fulfillment decreases.

The chapter explains how **misordered devotion** produces systemic frustration,
even when no explicit rebellion is present.

---

## Core MSR Principle for Haggai 01

> **When alignment with Source is deferred, productivity fragments and satisfaction collapses.**

## Haggai 1:1–2 — The Delay Identified

| King James Version | MSR Rendering |
|---|---|
| In the second year of Darius the king, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel… and to Joshua… | In a period of external governance, **Source instruction** addresses **governing will** and **spiritual mediation** directly. |
| This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD’S house should be built. | The inner community declares that **alignment work can wait**. |

**MSR Check**
- Sentence role: diagnosis of deferred priority ✔
- No rebellion named — only postponement ✔

---

## Haggai 1:3–4 — The Discrepancy Exposed

| King James Version | MSR Rendering |
|---|---|
| Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house lie waste? | Personal stability is pursued while **alignment infrastructure remains neglected**. |

**MSR Insight**
The issue is not comfort — it is **sequence**.

---

## Haggai 1:5–6 — The Consequence Pattern

| King James Version | MSR Rendering |
|---|---|
| Ye have sown much, and bring in little… | Effort increases while return diminishes due to **misordered priority**. |

**MSR Check**
- No punishment language ✔
- Cause-and-effect, not wrath ✔

---

## Haggai 1:7–9 — The Correction Issued

| King James Version | MSR Rendering |
|---|---|
| Consider your ways… Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house… | **Re-order devotion** and restore alignment, and coherence will follow. |

**MSR Insight**
The fix is not effort — it is **orientation**.

---

## Haggai 1:10–11 — Systemic Feedback Explained

| King James Version | MSR Rendering |
|---|---|
| Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew… | When alignment is absent, **supportive systems withdraw automatically**. |

**MSR Check**
- Environment reflects inner order ✔
- No metaphysical inflation ✔

---

## Haggai 1:12–15 — Alignment Restored

| King James Version | MSR Rendering |
|---|---|
| Then Zerubbabel… and all the remnant… obeyed the voice of the LORD… | **Will, mediation, and community realign**, restoring momentum. |
| I am with you, saith the LORD. | Presence returns once alignment is restored. |

---

## MSR Summary Statement

Haggai 01 teaches that:

- Misalignment does not always look like rebellion
- Deferred devotion fragments productivity
- Systems reflect priority, not effort
- Restoration begins with reordered allegiance
- Presence follows alignment, not activity

Nothing more is required for the chapter to function.
Nothing less explains why effort failed.

---

## MSR Status

- ✔ Functional integrity preserved
- ✔ No symbolic inflation
- ✔ Coherent with Matthew 6:33, Psalm 127, Proverbs 16
