# Isaiah 35 — The Highway of Holiness  
### *The Miracle of Joy in the Deserted Soul*

> _“The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them;  
> and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.”_  
> — **Isaiah 35 : 1**

---

## **BKV–NR — Narrative Reading**

### **I. The Desert Awakens (vv 1–2)**  
The **wilderness** represents the soul emptied by trial—the mind once barren of inspiration.  
When the inner winter has done its work, even that emptiness becomes fertile ground.  
The **desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose**: the rose is *love flowering where there was none*.  
It is the miracle of divine life emerging from what seemed impossible—  
the soul discovering that beauty was latent in its suffering all along.  

> *“It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing:  
> the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it,  
> the excellency of Carmel and Sharon.”*

Each **place-name** expresses a different aspect of this restored vitality:

| **Name** | **Literal Meaning / Landscape** | **BKV Symbolic Meaning** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lebanon** (“White,” snow-crowned forest) | The purity and elevation of the renewed intellect—reason washed clean and luminous. |
| **Carmel** (“Fruitful garden / vineyard”) | The creative, fruitful imagination bearing spiritual fruit. |
| **Sharon** (“Plain / level place”) | The balanced heart—emotions at rest, fertile and serene. |

These three together form the triad of a healed consciousness: **clarity of mind (Lebanon), creativity of soul (Carmel), and peace of heart (Sharon).**  
The desert’s miracle is not random beauty—it is *order restored* in thought, feeling, and will.

### **II. Strength for the Weary (vv 3–4)**  
> *“Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.”*

Once love re-enters, courage follows.  
“Hands” symbolize action; “knees,” prayer and humility.  
The Spirit commands both to stand firm.  

Say to the fearful heart: *“Be strong, fear not.”*  
When the consciousness is purified, even judgment becomes comfort—  
*“Behold, your God will come with vengeance… he will come and save you.”*  
That is, divine law corrects not to punish but to heal; the seeming vengeance is the removal of what harms life.

---

### **III. The Awakening of the Senses (vv 5–7)**  
> *“Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.”*

Each miracle is an inner faculty restored:
- **Eyes** — perception illuminated by truth.  
- **Ears** — receptivity to the inner Word.  
- **Lame** — will that once stumbled now walks in harmony.  
- **Dumb** — voice of praise released.

> *“In the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.”*  
The **living water** is spiritual understanding flowing again through consciousness.  
Where fear once cracked the ground, faith now irrigates it.  

> *“The parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water.”*  
The mind that once sought satisfaction in externals now drinks from within.

---

### **IV. The Highway of Holiness (vv 8–10)**  
> *“And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness.”*

The **Highway** is the direct current of spiritual life—a disciplined consciousness guided by love.  
“No lion shall be there,” for fear and predation cannot survive on higher altitude.  
“The redeemed shall walk there,” meaning every restored faculty now moves together in peace.

> *“They shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.”*  
This is not emotion but *state*: abiding joy, spontaneous harmony with divine rhythm.

## **BKV–DR — Divine Reflection**

There was a desert in me—  
a silence where prayer had dried to dust.  
But Love planted a rose there.  
No logic could explain its blooming, for it fed on light, not rain.  

When understanding returned, I saw that Lebanon (my intellect) had been cleansed,  
Carmel (my imagination) had begun to bear fruit again,  
and Sharon (my heart) lay calm as morning water.  

The miracle is not escape from wilderness but transfiguration within it.  
The same place that once echoed with emptiness now sings.  
This is the **glory of Zion**—  
not a city afar, but the summit of consciousness where God and man meet in peace.  

I will walk the Highway of Holiness.  
Each step is praise, each breath redemption.  
Joy is no longer the reward of striving—it is the atmosphere of being restored.

# 📜 Appendix — Scriptural Basis for the BKV Interpretation of the Cities in Isaiah 35

---

## 🌲 **Lebanon — Purified Intellect / Clarity of Thought**

**Literal landscape:**  
A high, snow-capped range north of Israel, famous for its white peaks and cedar forests. The word *Lebanon* (לְבָנוֹן / *L’vanon*) derives from *lavan* — “white,” signifying purity and brightness.

**BKV meaning:**  
The purified intellect — elevated reason washed of pride, receptive to divine illumination.

**Scriptural support:**

| Reference | Text / Summary | Connection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Psalm 92 : 12–13** | “The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.” | Cedars of Lebanon represent *upright, incorruptible strength* — purified thought aligned with righteousness. |
| **Hosea 14 : 5–7** | “He shall grow as the lily… his smell as Lebanon.” | After repentance, Israel’s fragrance is compared to Lebanon — symbolizing *spiritual clarity after renewal*. |
| **Isaiah 10 : 34** | “And Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.” | The fall of proud “Lebanon” in judgment images the *humbling of intellect* before divine wisdom — proving the same faculty can be purified. |
| **Zechariah 10 : 10** | “They shall pass through Lebanon… place shall not be found for them.” | In restoration, Lebanon becomes *territory reclaimed* — intellect brought into service of Spirit. |

---

## 🌿 **Carmel — Fruitful Imagination / Inspired Creativity**

**Literal landscape:**  
A lush mountain ridge on the Mediterranean, known for vineyards and gardens. *Carmel* (כַּרְמֶל / *Karmel*) literally means “garden land” or “vineyard of God.”

**BKV meaning:**  
The sanctified creative faculty — imagination and inspiration yielding spiritual fruit once the mind is aligned.

**Scriptural support:**

| Reference | Text / Summary | Connection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Isaiah 33 : 9** | “The earth mourneth… Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.” | When truth departs, Carmel loses fruitfulness — showing it symbolizes *spiritual productivity*. |
| **Song of Songs 7 : 5** | “Thine head upon thee is like Carmel.” | The head (seat of thought) likened to Carmel implies *lofty beauty and creative strength*. |
| **Amos 1 : 2** | “The top of Carmel shall wither.” | In judgment imagery, Carmel’s withering represents *inspiration cut off* — again proving its symbolic link to creative vitality. |
| **Jeremiah 50 : 19** | “He shall feed on Carmel and Bashan.” | Restoration brings the people to Carmel = *nourishment and abundance*. |

---

## 🌸 **Sharon — Peaceful Emotion / Balanced Heart**

**Literal landscape:**  
A broad coastal plain between Joppa and Mount Carmel, famous for its flowers and flocks. *Sharon* (שָׁרוֹן / *Sharon*) means “a level plain.”

**BKV meaning:**  
The heart at peace — emotional equilibrium, serenity, and the gentle beauty of simplicity.

**Scriptural support:**

| Reference | Text / Summary | Connection |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Song of Songs 2 : 1** | “I am the rose of Sharon.” | Sharon symbolizes *beauty, humility, and love blossoming in simplicity.* |
| **Isaiah 33 : 9** | “Sharon is like a wilderness.” | Loss of peace and harmony when the Spirit departs — confirming Sharon = *inner serenity.* |
| **Isaiah 65 : 10** | “Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down.” | After judgment, Sharon becomes *rest and restoration* — peace after turmoil. |
| **1 Chronicles 27 : 29** | “Over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite.” | The shepherding imagery reinforces Sharon as *pastoral care and calm provision.* |

## 🕊️ **Synthesis in Isaiah 35 : 2**

> _“The glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon;  
> they shall see the glory of the LORD, and the excellency of our God.”_

When the desert (emptied consciousness) begins to bloom, these three regions appear together — not randomly, but as **a trinity of restoration**:

| Faculty Restored | Symbolic Land | Function in the Redeemed Soul |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mind** | **Lebanon** | Purified intellect — thought made luminous and obedient. |
| **Soul / Imagination** | **Carmel** | Creative power sanctified — the flowering of inspired vision. |
| **Heart** | **Sharon** | Emotion balanced — peace and affection harmonized. |

Thus, the *glory of Lebanon*, the *fruitfulness of Carmel*, and the *peace of Sharon* together describe the fully regenerated consciousness — **the soul in bloom**.

---

### **The Miracle of the Rose in the Desert**

- The **rose** is the emblem of *life arising from barrenness* — divine affection expressing itself amid desolation.  
- The desert cannot produce it naturally; it appears by miracle, not by climate.  
- So too, the spiritual life is not humanly generated but divinely quickened.  
- Cross-reference *Song of Songs 2 : 1* (“I am the rose of Sharon”) and *Hosea 14 : 5–7* (“He shall blossom as the lily”).  
- The rose’s fragrance in the desert parallels the believer’s joy born from surrender — the unmistakable scent of divine presence where no growth should be possible.

---

## ✨ **Meaning of Zion in Isaiah 35**

> _“And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads.”_ — *Isaiah 35 : 10*

**Zion** here is not geographic but *experiential* — the summit of consciousness where redeemed faculties live under divine law.

| Aspect | Meaning | Supporting Scriptures |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Etymology** | “Fortress / Citadel” — high and secure place. | — |
| **BKV Interpretation** | State of spiritual alignment — the inner stronghold of peace and divine union. | *Ps 125 : 1; Heb 12 : 22; Rev 14 : 1.* |
| **Role in Isaiah 35** | The destination of the Highway of Holiness — the consciousness where joy and sorrow can no longer coexist. | *Isa 51 : 11* (“Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion.”) |

**Thus:**  
- Zion is the *end state of the journey* begun in the desert.  
- The desert symbolizes purification, the highway symbolizes disciplined movement, and Zion symbolizes *arrival in unity*.  
- In the BKV arc: **Desert → Highway → Zion** = *Purification → Practice → Presence.*

| **City / Region** | **Literal Quality** | **Symbolic Faculty** | **Result in the Redeemed Soul** |

| **Carmel** | Fertile hill / vineyard | Imagination sanctified | Creative fruitfulness, inspired vision |
| **Sharon** | Level plain / pasture | Emotion at rest | Peaceful, receptive heart |
| **Zion** | Fortress / sacred hill | Complete spiritual alignment | Union with Divine Presence, perpetual joy |
