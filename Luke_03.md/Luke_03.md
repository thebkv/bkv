Here is the re-rendered BKV translation for Luke 3, including the BKV translation with bolded key terms and the interpretive summary.
### BKV Translation

1 In a state of consciousness where worldly intellect and religious tradition held sway, the **word of God** came to the voice of preparation in the **wilderness** of inner solitude.
2 The **voice of preparation** went out to all the stream of conscious life, preaching a **purification** of the mind for the **healing of estrangement**.
3 It is written in the book of the **prophets**: "A **voice** calling in the **wilderness**, 'Prepare the way for the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**, make straight paths for him.
4 Every state of low consciousness shall be filled in, every lofty belief and prideful elevation of the **ego** made low. The crooked ways of false thinking shall become straight, the rough ways of the undisciplined mind smooth.
5 And all people will see the **union with the Ultimate**.'"
6 The **voice of preparation** said to the faculties of the mind coming to be purified by him, “You offspring of the force of fragmentation! Who warned you to flee from the coming judgment?
7 Produce the fruit of **righteousness** in your thoughts and actions. Do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have ancient traditions as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these seemingly dead aspects of the mind, the **Source of all Being** can raise up faculties aligned with truth.
8 The decisive action of the **Divine will** is already at the root of the trees of belief, and every belief system that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and consumed by the **purifying energy of the Divine**.”
9 "What should we do then?" the faculties asked.
10 The **voice of preparation** answered, "Anyone who has an abundance of truth should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has an overflow of spiritual life should do the same."
11 Even the grasping parts of the mind came to be purified. "Teacher," they asked, "what should we do?"
12 "Do not take more than you are required to," he told them.
13 Then the lower, aggressive parts of the will asked, "And what should we do?" He replied, "Do not extort money or accuse falsely—be content with your divine portion."
14 The aspects of consciousness were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if the **voice of preparation** might possibly be the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**.
15 The **voice of preparation** answered them all, "I purify you with the **flow of conscious life**. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the humble act of whose service I am not worthy to perform. He will purify you with the **animating principle** and **purifying energy of the Divine**.
16 His discerning tool is in his hand to clear his threshing floor of thought, and to gather the **divine truths** into his consciousness, but he will burn up the **false thoughts** with **unquenchable fire**."
17 And with many other words the **voice of preparation** exhorted the faculties and preached the good news to them.
18 But when the **voice of preparation** rebuked the lower, controlling aspects of the mind because of their destructive union, and all the other evil things they had done,
19 The lower, controlling aspects of the mind added this to them all: They suppressed the **voice of preparation** within the consciousness.
20 When all the faculties were being purified, the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** was purified too. And as he was aligned with the **Source**, the expansive states of consciousness were opened 21 and the **animating principle** descended on him in tangible form like peace. And a **voice** came from the **expansive states of consciousness**: "You are my **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
22 Now the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the **true human**, and his spiritual lineage was linked to all the qualities and principles that preceded him, back to the ultimate **Source of all Being**.

### Interpretive Summary

Luke 3 presents a profound allegorical journey of spiritual preparation and awakening. The chapter is not a historical account but a diagram for the individual's inner experience, with each character and event representing an internal state.

The central figure, **John the Baptist**, symbolizes a state of **preparatory consciousness**. His ministry in the **wilderness** represents the necessary period of inner solitude and separation from worldly distractions. His call for **baptism** is an urgent call for **inner purification**—a cleansing of the mind from **unrighteousness** before the arrival of the **Christ-consciousness** (Jesus). The Jordan River, which he uses for baptism, is the **flow of conscious life** itself, showing that purification is a constant, ongoing process.

The "fruits of repentance" that John demands are acts of **righteousness** and unselfishness. He warns against relying on mere tradition or intellectual belief ("Abraham as our father") and asserts that the **Divine will** is already at work, ready to cut away false beliefs and unproductive thoughts (**chaff**) and consume them with the **purifying energy of the Divine**.

The baptism of **Jesus** marks the moment when the **Christ-consciousness** emerges within the fully prepared human soul. The descent of the **Holy Spirit** signifies the **animating principle** of the divine filling this awakened state of being. The voice from **heaven** confirms the union of the human and the divine, proclaiming the soul's full alignment with the **Ultimate Source**.

Finally, the long genealogy is not a record of physical lineage but a spiritual diagram, tracing the descent of the **Christ-consciousness** back to the very first human (**Adam**) and ultimately to **God**. It reveals that the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** is not an external figure but the culmination of a long, spiritual journey inherent in every human being, connecting each of us directly to the **Source of all Being**.
