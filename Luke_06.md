# Luke 6

---

1. One day of **inner rest** the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** was moving through the **fields of thought**, and his **faculties** began to take nourishment from the **divine truths** found there, rub them in their hands and consume the inner kernels.
2. Some of the **established religious intellect** asked, “Why are you doing what is unlawful on the **day of inner rest**?”
3. The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** answered them, “Have you never read what the **divine rule** did when he and his companion **principles** were spiritually hungry?
4. He entered the **inner sanctuary** and took the **consecrated truth**, which is lawful only for the **principles of spiritual authority** to consume, and he also gave some to his companion **principles**.”
5. Then he said to them, “The **true human** is the **master** of the **day of inner rest**.”
6. On another **day of inner rest**, he went into the **community of thought** and was imparting **wisdom**, and a **faculty** was there whose ability to act was **spiritually atrophied**.
7. The **established religious intellect** and the **rigid, intellectual beliefs** were looking for a reason to find fault with the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**, so they watched him closely to see if he would restore on the **day of inner rest**.
8. But the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** knew what they were thinking and said to the **spiritually atrophied faculty**, “Rise up and stand in front of every other **faculty**.” So he rose up and stood there.
9. Then the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** said to them, “I ask you, which is lawful on the **day of inner rest**: to do good or to do harm, to save a principle or to destroy it?”
10. He looked around at them all, and then said to the **faculty**, “Activate your dormant ability.” He did so, and his ability to act was completely restored.
11. But the **established religious intellect** and the **rigid, intellectual beliefs** were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**.
12. One of those days the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** went out to a higher state of **consciousness** to commune, and spent the night communing with the **Source of all Being**.
13. When morning came, he called his **principles** to him and chose twelve of them, whom he also designated as **operative spiritual faculties**:
14. The **receptive hearing** (whom he named **foundation**), his brother **strength**, the **overcomer**, the **divine grace**, the **lover of power**, the **grounded, practical effort**,
15. the **inner will**, the **skeptical twin**, the **overcomer** with a sense of **change**, the **fervent** principle,
16. and the principle of **praise** and **surrender**, and the **shadow-self** who became the **betrayal** of the **truth**.
17. He went down with them and stood on a level place of being. A large number of his **principles** was there and a great multitude of **human consciousnesses** from all over the **religious tradition**, from the **spiritual consciousness**, and from the **receptive and receptive states** of the soul,
18. who had come to hear his **wisdom** and to be healed of their **spiritual sicknesses**. Those troubled by **fragmented principles** were cured,
19. and the **human consciousnesses** all tried to make contact with him, because the **animating principle** was coming from him and healing them all.
20. Looking at his **principles**, he said: “A divine blessing is on you who are **poor in spirit**, for yours is the **mastery of the lower nature** of the **Source**.
21. A divine blessing is on you who are **spiritually hungry** now, for you will be filled with **truth**. A divine blessing is on you who grieve for the **spiritually estranged** now, for you will laugh with **divine understanding**.
22. A divine blessing is on you when other parts of your **consciousness** hate you, when they cast you out and insult you and reject your true nature as a **false belief**, because of the **true human**.
23. “Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in the **higher consciousness**. For that is how the old beliefs treated the **prophetic principles**.
24. “But woe to you who are full of worldly satisfaction, for you have already received your comfort.
25. Woe to you who are **spiritually complacent** now, for you will yearn for **truth**. Woe to you who laugh with **worldly pleasure** now, for you will mourn and grieve.
26. Woe to you when every **thought** speaks well of you, for that is how the old beliefs treated the **false teachings**.
27. “But to you who are listening I say: Embrace your **inner conflicts**, do good to those parts of your **consciousness** that oppose you,
28. bless the thoughts that curse you, pray for the feelings that mistreat you.
29. If an opposing thought strikes you on one aspect of your nature, turn to it the other also. If a **thought** takes your outer being, do not withhold your inner self from them.
30. Give to every aspect of your **consciousness** that asks of you, and if any thought takes what belongs to your **true self**, do not demand it back.
31. Do to other parts of your **consciousness** as you would have them do to you.
32. “If you love those thoughts that love you, what reward is that to you? Even **spiritually estranged aspects** love those that love them.
33. And if you do good to those thoughts that are good to you, what reward is that to you? Even **spiritually estranged aspects** do that.
34. And if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment, what reward is that to you? Even **spiritually estranged aspects** lend to **spiritually estranged aspects**, expecting to be repaid in full.
35. But embrace your **inner conflicts**, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be expressions of the **Most High**, because he is kind to the ungrateful and spiritually wicked.
36. Be merciful, just as your **Source** is merciful.
37. “Do not activate your inner **critic**, and you will not be criticized. Do not condemn aspects of your **consciousness**, and you will not be condemned. Forgive the **estrangement**, and you will be forgiven.
38. Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your being. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.”
39. He also told them this **spiritual lesson**: “Can a **spiritually unaware** faculty guide a **spiritually unaware** one? Will they not both fall into a state of deep unknowing?
40. The **student** is not above the **teacher**, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their **teacher**.
41. “Why do you look at the insignificant fault in your brother's awareness and pay no attention to the major flaw in your own awareness?
42. How can you say to your brother's awareness, ‘Let me take the insignificant fault out of your awareness,’ when you yourself fail to see the major flaw in your own awareness? You hypocrite, first take the major flaw out of your own awareness, and then you will see clearly to remove the insignificant fault from your brother's awareness.
43. “No **good principle** bears **destructive results**, nor does a **destructive principle** bear **good results**.
44. Each **principle** is recognized by its own **results**. **Faculties** do not pick **sweet truths** from **painful beliefs**, or **divine expression** from **aggressive thoughts**.
45. A **spiritually whole** faculty brings **good results** out of the **good truths** stored up in its inner being, and a **spiritually estranged** faculty brings **destructive results** out of the **destructive patterns** stored up in its inner being. For the outer expression speaks what the inner being is full of.
46. “Why do you call me ‘**Ultimate Reality**, **Ultimate Reality**,’ and do not act as I say?
47. As for everyone who comes to me and hears my **truths** and puts them into **practice**, I will show you what they are like.
48. They are like a **faculty** building its **consciousness**, who dug down deep and laid the **spiritual foundation** on **immovable truth**. When a **flood** of inner chaos came, the torrent of **confusion** struck that consciousness but could not shake it, because it was well built.
49. But the one who hears my **truths** and does not put them into **practice** is like a **faculty** who built a **consciousness** on the **shifting sands of the worldly mind** without a **spiritual foundation**. When the torrent of **confusion** struck that consciousness, it collapsed and its destruction was complete.”
