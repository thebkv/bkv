# Luke 3

---

## BKV Translation

1 In a state of consciousness where worldly intellect and religious tradition held sway, the **word of God** came to the voice of preparation in the **wilderness** of inner solitude.
2 The **voice of preparation** went out to all the stream of conscious life, preaching a **purification** of the mind for the **healing of estrangement**.
3 It is written in the book of the **prophets**: "A **voice** calling in the **wilderness**, 'Prepare the way for the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**, make straight paths for him.
4 Every state of low consciousness shall be filled in, every lofty belief and prideful elevation of the **ego** made low. The crooked ways of false thinking shall become straight, the rough ways of the undisciplined mind smooth.
5 And all people will see the **union with the Ultimate**.'"
6 The **voice of preparation** said to the faculties of the mind coming to be purified by him, “You offspring of the force of fragmentation! Who warned you to flee from the coming judgment?
7 Produce the fruit of **righteousness** in your thoughts and actions. Do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have ancient traditions as our father.’ For I tell you that out of these seemingly dead aspects of the mind, the **Source of all Being** can raise up faculties aligned with truth.
8 The decisive action of the **Divine will** is already at the root of the trees of belief, and every belief system that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and consumed by the **purifying energy of the Divine**.”
9 "What should we do then?" the faculties asked.
10 The **voice of preparation** answered, "Anyone who has an abundance of truth should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has an overflow of spiritual life should do the same."
11 Even the grasping parts of the mind came to be purified. "Teacher," they asked, "what should we do?"
12 "Do not take more than you are required to," he told them.
13 Then the lower, aggressive parts of the will asked, "And what should we do?" He replied, "Do not extort money or accuse falsely—be content with your divine portion."
14 The aspects of consciousness were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if the **voice of preparation** might possibly be the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**.
15 The **voice of preparation** answered them all, "I purify you with the **flow of conscious life**. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the humble act of whose service I am not worthy to perform. He will purify you with the **animating principle** and **purifying energy of the Divine**.
16 His discerning tool is in his hand to clear his threshing floor of thought, and to gather the **divine truths** into his consciousness, but he will burn up the **false thoughts** with **unquenchable fire**."
17 And with many other words the **voice of preparation** exhorted the faculties and preached the good news to them.
18 But when the **voice of preparation** rebuked the lower, controlling aspects of the mind because of their destructive union, and all the other evil things they had done,
19 The lower, controlling aspects of the mind added this to them all: They suppressed the **voice of preparation** within the consciousness.
20 When all the faculties were being purified, the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** was purified too. And as he was aligned with the **Source**, the expansive states of consciousness were opened 21 and the **animating principle** descended on him in tangible form like peace. And a **voice** came from the **expansive states of consciousness**: "You are my **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**, whom I love; with you I am well pleased."
22 Now the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was the **true human**, and his spiritual lineage was linked to all the qualities and principles that preceded him, back to the ultimate **Source of all Being**.

### Scriptural and Symbolic Defenses

The BKV's interpretations are designed to be entirely defensible through a consistent symbolic language found throughout scripture, supported by name meanings and recurring allegorical themes. The definitions are not arbitrary but are drawn from a long tradition of spiritual and metaphysical interpretation.

The following are the scriptural and symbolic foundations for the key terms used in the Luke 3 translation.

---

#### **1. John the Baptist as “Preparatory Consciousness”**

* **Name Meaning:** The name John (Hebrew: *Yochanan*) means "Yahweh is gracious" or "Yahweh has shown favor." This points to his role as a manifestation of a divine grace that prepares the way for a higher state of being.
* **Scriptural Role:** All four Gospels present John as the "forerunner," consistently stating that he came to prepare the way for one who was greater. His purpose was never the end goal, but the necessary step of calling for **purification** before the arrival of the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**. Isaiah 40:3, quoted directly in Luke 3, confirms this: "A voice of one calling in the **wilderness**, 'Prepare the way for the Lord.'"

#### **2. The Wilderness as “Inner Solitude”**

* **Symbolic Theme:** The **wilderness** in the Bible is a consistent symbol of a spiritual transition away from the bondage of the world and toward a deeper truth. The Israelites' 40 years in the desert after escaping Egypt (Exodus 16) and Jesus's 40 days of fasting and temptation (Matthew 4) both represent periods of stripping away the false self and preparing for a new spiritual state. It is a place of trial and purification, not of easy living.

#### **3. The Jordan River as the “Flow of Conscious Life”**

* **Scriptural Context:** The Jordan River marks the final barrier between the **wilderness** and the **promised land** (Canaan), which in the BKV represents **inner union**. When the Israelites cross the Jordan (Joshua 3), they move from a state of wandering to one of **wholeness**. The Jordan's waters are the medium through which this transition occurs, symbolizing the current of conscious life that must be purified for the soul to reach its true home.

#### **4. Baptism as “Purification”**

* **Biblical Meaning:** The act of baptism is an immersion in water for "the forgiveness of sins" (Luke 3:3). This is not just a ritual but a symbol of being washed clean of **sin**, which the BKV defines as **separation** from the Divine. The physical act represents a spiritual cleansing of the mind and soul, aligning perfectly with the allegorical term **purification**.

#### **5. The Genealogy as a “Spiritual Lineage”**

* **Literal Clue:** The lineage in Luke 3 is immediately qualified by the phrase "the son, so it was thought, of Joseph." This textual hint signals that the lineage is not purely physical.
* **Symbolic Descent:** The genealogy is read backward, starting with Jesus and going all the way to "Adam, the son of God." This is a powerful allegorical statement. It shows that the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** is not just a figure in history, but a spiritual heritage. It traces the spiritual potential that began with humanity (**Adam**) through a long lineage of qualities and principles, culminating in the fully realized **true human** in Jesus. The genealogy is a map showing that every person's true ancestry is divine.

## Interpretive Summary

Luke 3 presents a profound allegorical journey of spiritual preparation and awakening. The chapter is not a historical account but a diagram for the individual's inner experience, with each character and event representing an internal state.

The central figure, **John the Baptist**, symbolizes a state of **preparatory consciousness**. His ministry in the **wilderness** represents the necessary period of inner solitude and separation from worldly distractions. His call for **baptism** is an urgent call for **inner purification**—a cleansing of the mind from **unrighteousness** before the arrival of the **Christ-consciousness** (Jesus). The Jordan River, which he uses for baptism, is the **flow of conscious life** itself, showing that purification is a constant, ongoing process.

The "fruits of repentance" that John demands are acts of **righteousness** and unselfishness. He warns against relying on mere tradition or intellectual belief ("Abraham as our father") and asserts that the **Divine will** is already at work, ready to cut away false beliefs and unproductive thoughts (**chaff**) and consume them with the **purifying energy of the Divine**.

The baptism of **Jesus** marks the moment when the **Christ-consciousness** emerges within the fully prepared human soul. The descent of the **Holy Spirit** signifies the **animating principle** of the divine filling this awakened state of being. The voice from **heaven** confirms the union of the human and the divine, proclaiming the soul's full alignment with the **Ultimate Source**.

Finally, the long genealogy is not a record of physical lineage but a spiritual diagram, tracing the descent of the **Christ-consciousness** back to the very first human (**Adam**) and ultimately to **God**. It reveals that the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** is not an external figure but the culmination of a long, spiritual journey inherent in every human being, connecting each of us directly to the **Source of all Being**.
