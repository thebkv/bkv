# **1 Samuel 1 — The Principle of Earnest Desire**
### *The Birth of True Prayer Within the Soul*

> _“For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him.”_ — **1 Samuel 1:27 KJV**

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

### **I. The Divided House (vv 1–8)**

There was a certain man of **Ramathaim-Zophim (the Heights of Dual Vision)** whose name was **Elkanah (God Has Purchased)**, and he had two wives: **Hannah (Grace)** and **Peninnah (Self-Fruitful)**.

*This household represents the **divided inner state** — the coexistence of spiritual longing (Hannah) and self-sufficiency (Peninnah). The soul’s devotion and its pride dwell under one roof.*

Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.
Every year Elkanah went up to **Shiloh (Tranquility)** to worship and sacrifice unto the Source of Hosts.
Hannah’s barrenness brought her grief, while **Peninnah’s provocation** represented the taunt of the **Egoic Mind** that boasts of **manifested results**.

Elkanah comforted her, saying, “Am I not better to thee than ten sons?”
*The **human will** tries to console spiritual longing by offering emotional satisfaction — but Grace seeks something deeper than comfort: **fulfillment through divine expression**.*

### **II. The Cry of the Soul (vv 9–18)**

Hannah rose after they had eaten and drank in Shiloh.
She entered the **Temple of the Source**, where **Eli (Uplifted Awareness)** sat by the post of the door.

In bitterness of soul she prayed and wept sore, vowing:
> “O Source of Hosts, if You will indeed look upon the affliction of Your handmaid and give Your handmaid a man-child, I will give him unto You all the days of his life.”

*This is the **inner vow** — when the soul, in its deep desire, consecrates the very object of its longing back to the Source.*

Eli observed her lips move, but her voice was not heard; he thought she was drunken.
She replied, “No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit… I have poured out my soul before the Source.”

Then **Eli (Uplifted Awareness)** said, “Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition.”
Hannah departed, and her countenance was no more sad.
*Once **true prayer** is offered, the consciousness rests — faith becomes serenity.*

### **III. The Birth and Dedication (vv 19–28)**

They rose early and worshiped before the Source.
In due time, Hannah conceived and bore a son, and called his name **Samuel (Heard of God)**, saying,
> “Because I have asked him of the Source.”

When the child was weaned, she brought him to the house of the Source at Shiloh, with offerings of gratitude, and said,
> “For this child I prayed, and the Source has granted me my petition; therefore also I have lent him to the Source; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Source.”

*Thus the answered prayer becomes an **offering** — the fulfilled desire is returned to its origin, and the gift becomes a **channel of revelation**.*

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Samuel 1** unfolds the mystery of **Conceived Prayer** — how longing becomes creation through **surrender**.

* **Hannah (Grace)** represents the **spiritual heart** — the receptive, humble faculty that feels barren until united with divine intention.
* **Peninnah (Self-Fruitful)** symbolizes the **egoic mind**, content with its own productivity, blind to the inner call.
* **Elkanah (God Has Purchased)** is the **human will consecrated to God**, mediating between these two impulses.
* **Shiloh (Tranquility)** is the **state of inner stillness** where communion is possible.
* **Eli (Uplifted Awareness)** is **spiritual discernment** — often slow to recognize true devotion, yet capable of confirming divine action when awakened.
* **Samuel (Heard of God)** is the **manifest Word** — the **Prophetic Intuition**; the birth of direct communication between the soul and the Source.

Hannah’s vow marks the transition from **personal longing** to **selfless offering**.
Her prayer is answered not because she demands, but because she *aligns* — she releases the desire to ownership and dedicates it to divine service.

## **Addendum — The Law of Conceived Prayer**

Prayer matures in three stages:

1.  **Longing** — the recognition of lack.
2.  **Consecration** — the vow that returns desire to its Source.
3.  **Fulfillment** — the manifestation of that desire as service.

Every true “Samuel” — every inspired work, idea, or action — is born through the same law: **Grace conceives through surrender.**

---

## **Core BKV Principle — 1 Samuel 1**

> **When Grace ceases to plead for itself and dedicates its longing to the Source, desire becomes creation, and prayer gives birth to revelation.**
