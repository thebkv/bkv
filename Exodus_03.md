_“The bush burned but was not consumed…”_  
_“So remove your sandals—this is holy ground.”_

1. Now the **Principle of Divine Law** was tending the **principles of innocence** of his **principle of spiritual counsel**. He led the **principles of innocence** to the far side of the **state of testing** and came to the **high point of spiritual attainment**.
2. There the **active operative principle of Spirit** appeared to him in **fiery intensity** emanating from within a **human manifestation**. The **Principle of Divine Law** saw that the **human manifestation** was aflame with **Divine Fire**, yet the **manifestation** was not consumed.
3. So the **Principle of Divine Law** thought, “I will go over and see this strange sight—why the **human manifestation** does not burn up.”
4. When the **Ultimate Reality** saw that he had turned aside to look, the **Ultimate Reality** called to him from within the **human manifestation**, “**Principle of Divine Law! Principle of Divine Law!**” And he said, “Here I am.”
5. “Do not come any closer,” the **Ultimate Reality** said. “Take off your **fixed beliefs** from your **spiritual foundation**, for the place where you are standing is the immediate **presence of the Divine within the soul**.”
6. Then he said, “I am the **Source** of your ancestral **beliefs**—the **Source** of **Spiritual Identity**, the **Source** of **Principle of Inner Sight**, and the **Source** of **Integrated Consciousness**.” The **Principle of Divine Law** hid his face, because he was afraid to look at the **Source of all Being**.
7. The **Ultimate Reality** said, “I have indeed seen the **spiritual suffering** of my **spiritual identities** in the **state of bondage**. I have heard them crying out because of their **egoic taskmasters**, and I am concerned about their **spiritual suffering**.
8. So I have come down to **rescue** them from the hand of the **egoic will** and to bring them up out of that **state of bondage** into a good and spacious **state of consciousness**, a **realized state** flowing with **spiritual abundance**. The place of the **spiritual opposition** is there.
9. And now the cry of the **spiritual identities** has reached me, and I have seen the way the **egoic will** is **oppressing** them.
10. So now, go. I am sending you to the **egoic will** to bring my **spiritual identities** out of the **state of bondage**.”
11. But the **Principle of Divine Law** said to the **Ultimate Reality**, “Who am I, that I should go to the **egoic will** and bring the **spiritual identities** out of the **state of bondage**?”
12. And the **Ultimate Reality** said, “I will be with you. And this will be the **certainty** that I have sent you: when you have brought the **principles** out of the **state of bondage**, you will perform **acts of complete devotion** on this **high point of spiritual attainment**.”
13. The **Principle of Divine Law** said to the **Ultimate Reality**, “If I go to the **spiritual identities** and tell them, ‘The **Source** of your ancestral **beliefs** has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’—what should I tell them?”
14. The **Ultimate Reality** said to the **Principle of Divine Law**, “**I AM WHO I AM.**” This is what you are to say to the **spiritual identities**: **‘The Self-Existent Reality** has sent me to you.’”
15. The **Ultimate Reality** also said to the **Principle of Divine Law**, “Say to the **spiritual identities**, ‘The **Ultimate Reality**, the **Source** of your ancestral **beliefs**—has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever, the name you shall use in every **cycle of consciousness**.”
