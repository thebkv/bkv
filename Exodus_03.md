_“The bush burned but was not consumed…”_  
_“So remove your sandals—this is holy ground.”_

1.  Now the **Principle of Divine Law** was tending the **Aspects of Innocence** of his **principle of spiritual counsel**. He led the **Aspects of Innocence** to the far side of the **state of testing** and came to the **high point of spiritual attainment**.
2.  There the **active operative principle of Spirit** appeared to him in **fiery intensity** emanating from within a **human manifestation**. The **Principle of Divine Law** saw that the **human manifestation** was aflame with **Divine Fire**, yet the **manifestation** was not consumed.
3.  So the **Principle of Divine Law** thought, “I will go over and see this strange sight—why the **human manifestation** does not burn up.”
4.  When the **Ultimate Reality** saw that he had turned aside to look, the **Ultimate Reality** called to him from within the **human manifestation**, “**Principle of Divine Law! Principle of Divine Law!**” And he said, “Here I am.”
5.  “Do not come any closer,” the **Ultimate Reality** said. “Take off your **fixed beliefs** from your **spiritual foundation**, for the place where you are standing is the immediate **presence of the Divine within the soul**.”
6.  Then he said, “I am the **Source** of your ancestral **beliefs**—the **Source** of **Spiritual Identity**, the **Source** of **Principle of Inner Sight**, and the **Source** of **Integrated Consciousness**.” The **Principle of Divine Law** hid his face, because he was afraid to look at the **Source of all Being**.
7.  The **Ultimate Reality** said, “I have indeed seen the **spiritual suffering** of my **Aspects of the Soul** in the **state of bondage**. I have heard them crying out because of their **egoic taskmasters**, and I am concerned about their **spiritual suffering**.
8.  So I have come down to **rescue** them from the hand of the **Egoic Will** and to bring them up out of that **state of bondage** into a good and spacious **state of consciousness**, a **realized state** flowing with **spiritual abundance**. The place of the **spiritual opposition** is there.
9.  And now the cry of the **Aspects of the Soul** has reached me, and I have seen the way the **Egoic Will** is **oppressing** them.
10. So now, go. I am sending you to the **Egoic Will** to bring my **Aspects of the Soul** out of the **state of bondage**.”
11. But the **Principle of Divine Law** said to the **Ultimate Reality**, “Who am I, that I should go to the **Egoic Will** and bring the **Aspects of the Soul** out of the **state of bondage**?”
12. And the **Ultimate Reality** said, “I will be with you. And this will be the **certainty** that I have sent you: when you have brought the **Aspects of the Soul** out of the **state of bondage**, you will perform **acts of complete devotion** on this **high point of spiritual attainment**.”
13. The **Principle of Divine Law** said to the **Ultimate Reality**, “If I go to the **Aspects of the Soul** and tell them, ‘The **Source** of your ancestral **beliefs** has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’—what should I tell them?”
14. The **Ultimate Reality** said to the **Principle of Divine Law**, “**I AM WHO I AM.**” This is what you are to say to the **Aspects of the Soul**: **‘The Self-Existent Reality** has sent me to you.’”
15. The **Ultimate Reality** also said to the **Principle of Divine Law**, “Say to the **Aspects of the Soul**, ‘The **Ultimate Reality**, the **Source** of your ancestral **beliefs**—has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever, the name you shall use in every **cycle of consciousness**.”
