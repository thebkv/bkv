## BKV-NR (Natural Reading)

1. And the **Living Utterance** of the **Self-Existent Reality** came unto **The Principle of Divine Conscience (Jonah)** the **Second Time (Renewed Mandate)**, saying,
2. “Arise, go unto **The Great State of Unredeemed External Consciousness (Nineveh)**, that **Great City**, and **Active Utterance** the **Divine Mandate** that I bid you.”
3. So **The Principle of Divine Conscience** arose, and went unto **The Great State of Unredeemed External Consciousness**, according to the **Living Utterance** of the **Self-Existent Reality**. Now **The Great State of Unredeemed External Consciousness** was an exceeding **Great City** of **Three Cycles of Consciousness (Three Days’) Journey**.
4. And **The Principle of Divine Conscience** began to enter into the **City** a **Day’s Journey**, and he cried, and said, “Yet **Forty Cycles of Testing (Forty Days)**, and **The Great State of Unredeemed External Consciousness** shall be **Overthrown**.”
5. So the **Total Principles** in **The Great State of Unredeemed External Consciousness** **Believed** the **Divine Source**, and proclaimed a **Principle of Humiliation (Fasting)**, and put on **Self-Denial (Sackcloth)**, from the **Highest Ego-Principle (Greatest)** even to the **Simplest Thought (Least)**.
6. For word came unto the **Highest Ego-Principle (King)** of **The Great State of Unredeemed External Consciousness**, and he arose from his **Seat of Authority**, and he laid his **Royal Principle (Robe)** from him, and covered him with **Self-Denial**, and sat in **Inner Dust**.
7. And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through **The Great State of Unredeemed External Consciousness** by the decree of the **Highest Ego-Principle** and his **Inner Rulers**, saying, “Let neither **Aspect of Man** nor **Principle of the Beast** taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink **Inner Waters**:
8. But let **Aspect of Man** and **Principle of the Beast** be covered with **Self-Denial**, and cry mightily unto **Divine Authority**: yes, let them turn every **Principle** from his **Spiritual Disorder**, and from the **Violence** that is in their **Inner Hands**.
9. Who can tell if **Divine Authority** will turn and repent, and turn away from **His Fierce Wrath**, that we perish not?”
10. And **Divine Authority** saw their **Spiritual Works**, that they turned from their **Spiritual Disorder**; and **Divine Authority** **Relented** of the **Inner Destruction** that **He** had said **He** would do unto them; and **He** did it not.

## Commentary on the Action

The chapter begins with the **Renewed Mandate** to the now-obedient **Principle of Divine Conscience**. The **Conscience** immediately acts, penetrating the full scope of the **Unredeemed External Consciousness (Three Days' Journey)**. The warning sets a **Cycle of Testing (Forty Days)**. The result is the complete, instantaneous acceptance (**Immediate Receptivity**) by the **External Consciousness**, from the **Highest Ego-Principle (King)** down to the lowest thoughts. The mass repentance—expressed through **Self-Denial and Humiliation** (fasting and sackcloth)—demonstrates the sincere turning away from **Spiritual Disorder**. The final action confirms the core BKV principle: the **Divine Source** responds to the sincere, total, inner turning of the soul, granting **Relief from Inner Destruction**.

## Interpretive Insights

**I.1. The Power of the Renewed Mandate (Jonah 3:1-3):** The fact that the Word comes a **Second Time** emphasizes the Divine persistence and the concept of **Regeneration**. The **Principle of Divine Conscience** is no longer acting on its own flawed judgment, but is speaking the *exact* **Divine Mandate** it was given. The subsequent obedience is absolute ("Jonah arose... according to the Word"), showing that the inner transformation of Jonah 2 has succeeded in making the **Conscience** a perfect conduit for the Divine Will.

**I.2. The Scope of Consciousness (Jonah 3:3-5):**
* **Three Days’ Journey:** Represents the **Complete Scope of Consciousness**—the three parts of the soul (often symbolized as Mind, Spirit, Body, or Past, Present, Future). The **External Consciousness** (Nineveh) is vast, meaning the **Conscience** must address the entire structure.
* **Immediate Receptivity:** The instantaneous belief and repentance, triggered by only a single day's preaching, is allegorically significant. It illustrates that once the **Conscience** speaks the **Pure Divine Word** (without self-will), the **External Consciousness**—even in its most chaotic state—is immediately ready to believe.

**I.3. Total Inner Humiliation (Jonah 3:6-8):** The repentance is total, encompassing the King, the nobles, the common principles, *and the beasts*.
* **King:** The **Highest Ego-Principle**. His humility is critical; the will must surrender its authority.
* **Beast:** The **Lower/Animalistic Principles** of the soul. The repentance must extend to the most base, instinctual parts of the self (fasting/sackcloth for the beasts).
This total, holistic **Act of Self-Denial and Humiliation** is the **Spiritual Work** that the **Divine Source** sees and responds to, leading to the **Relief from Inner Destruction**.
