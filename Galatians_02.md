# Galatians 2 — The Integration of Liberty and Law

| **Authorized (KJV)** | **BKV–NR (Symbolic Narrative Reading)** |
|:--|:--|
| **1.** Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also. | After two full cycles of inner completion, **Awakened Consciousness (Paul)** ascends once more to the **Inner Seat of Divine Order (Jerusalem)**, bringing **Encouragement (Barnabas)** and **Sincerity (Titus)** together in harmony. |
| **2.** And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain. | Guided by inward revelation, the soul reveals its truth to the higher powers of understanding, testing whether its faith-born insight accords with divine order — that its labor not be wasted in self-delusion. |
| **3.** But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. | Yet **Sincerity (Titus)**, though from the natural side of consciousness, was not forced into **outward conformity (circumcision)** — for the Spirit values the inner reality over the external sign. |
| **4.** And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage. | Certain **counterfeit thoughts (false brethren)** secretly intrude, trying to observe and steal away the **inner liberty of Christ-consciousness**, pulling the soul back toward **bondage** to form and approval. |
| **5.** To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you. | The awakened mind yields to such illusions not even for a moment, so that the **truth of inner revelation** may remain intact and uncorrupted. |
| **6.** But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me. | Those who appeared important — high-ranking thoughts of self-importance — contribute nothing to true awareness, for **Spirit recognizes no hierarchy of persons**, only the radiance of truth itself. |
| **7.** But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter; | Rather, they discern that the **message of spiritual freedom** is entrusted to **Awakened Consciousness (Paul)**, just as the **faith of order and form** is given to **Faith-in-Action (Peter)**. |
| **8.** (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:) | The same Spirit that empowers **Faith (Peter)** to serve those within structure also works powerfully through **Awakened Consciousness (Paul)** to reach the natural faculties beyond it. |
| **9.** And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision. | Then the **Pillars of the Inner Temple — Wisdom (James), Faith (Peter), and Love (John)** — perceive the grace within the awakened self and extend the **hand of fellowship** to **Encouragement (Barnabas)** and **Awakened Consciousness (Paul)**, affirming unity of purpose: one to minister within structure, the other to the unformed. |
| **10.** Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do. | Only this charge remains: to care for **the humble and undeveloped parts of the soul (the poor)** — a command the awakened self gladly fulfills. |
| **11.** But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed. | Yet when **Faith (Peter)** enters **Antioch** — the meeting ground where intellect and faith converge — it falters through fear and must be corrected by **Awakened Consciousness (Paul)**, for inconsistency weakens truth. |
| **12.** For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision. | Before the influence of **Wisdom (James)** appeared, **Faith** freely joined the natural faculties (the Gentiles); but under scrutiny, fear of disapproval caused withdrawal into self-protection and separation. |
| **13.** And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation. | Other structured thoughts imitated this divided stance, and even **Encouragement (Barnabas)** was momentarily drawn into the illusion of outward correctness. |
| **14.** But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews? | Seeing this, **Awakened Consciousness** exposes the contradiction: if **Faith**, though rooted in structure, now lives freely, why impose structure on those who have already found liberty? |
| **15.** We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, | We who have been raised under spiritual discipline, not in the ignorance of the outer life— |
| **16.** Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. | —know that no one is made whole by outward observance, but through **trust in the indwelling Christ**, the living Principle of Grace. The mind itself cannot purify the flesh by law; only Spirit can. |
| **17.** But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid. | Yet if, while trusting the inner Christ, we still fall short, that does not make the Spirit a source of failure — rather, it exposes what yet must be transformed. |
| **18.** For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. | To rebuild the old structures of legalism after freedom has dawned is to re-enslave oneself — to deny the grace already received. |
| **19.** For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. | For through the mirror of law, the self has seen its limitation and died to it, awakening to life in the divine. |
| **20.** I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. | The **egoic self** has been **crucified with the Christ-principle**; yet true life remains — the **Divine Life within** living through the human form, sustained by conscious trust in divine love and self-giving. |
| **21.** I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. | Therefore, the awakened soul does not resist grace, for if harmony could come through rule-keeping alone, the indwelling Christ would have no purpose — and divine love would be emptied of meaning. |
