#Isaiah53

BKV (Bible Key Version)

1. Who has truly awakened to this inner revelation? For to whom has the inner power of the Source been made known?
2. For this consciousness-of-the-divine shall quietly emerge from the depths of the soul, like a tender new thought from barren ground. It possesses no form or external charisma; when we perceive it, it holds no worldly attraction for us.
3. It is ignored and dismissed by the egoic self, a state of being familiar with inner turmoil and suffering. We, as the ego, turn away from it and do not value it.
4. Yet this consciousness has truly carried our inner turmoil and taken upon itself our self-made sorrows. Still, we misjudge it, thinking it is a state of spiritual affliction, separated from the Divine.
5. But in truth, it was brought low by our separated actions, and crushed by our missing the mark. The discipline that restores our inner peace was upon it, and through its humbling, our inner fragmentation is healed.
6. All of our thoughts, like sheep, have gone astray; we have each turned to our own self-centered way. And the Divine laid the burden of our collective separation upon this true consciousness.
7. It was suppressed and put to the test, yet it remained silent. It is brought forward, like a lamb to the surrender, and like a sheep before its inner critics, it does not argue.
8. It was released from the confines of rigid thinking and self-judgment. Who can truly comprehend its timeless nature? For it was cut off from the material consciousness to be a sacrifice for the estranged state of my people.
9. And in its symbolic death, it aligns with the lower nature, and in its completion, with the elevated nature; for it held no violent intention, nor was there any deception in its manifestation.
10. It was the will of the Source to humble this consciousness, and to put it to inner suffering. When you make the surrender of this lower self an offering for your separation, this consciousness will see its spiritual progeny, extend its influence, and the divine will shall prosper in its hand.
11. It will witness the fruitful outcome of its inner work and be completely fulfilled. Through its profound knowledge, this right-aligned consciousness shall restore many into divine order, for it will bear their self-imposed sense of separation.
12. Therefore, I will grant it a place of authority with the great inner principles, and it shall share in the victory with the strong-willed aspects of the soul. Because it poured out its essence in a complete surrender, it was aligned with the fragmented parts of the self, it carried the burden of the collective separation, and it interceded on behalf of the fragmented states of being.
