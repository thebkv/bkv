# 📖 Psalm 147  
### *The Rebuilder of the Soul — The Law of Restoration*

| **Authorized Version (KJV)** | **Bible Key Version — Inner Reading** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1 Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.** | Praise rises from the humbled heart.  It is good to sing to **Divine Order**, for praise aligns the soul with harmony and beauty. |
| **2 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.** | The Spirit rebuilds **Jerusalem (the inner city of peace)** and gathers the scattered powers of the soul — those faculties once lost to self-will. |
| **3 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.** | He restores divided feeling into unity, binding every wounded affection into wholeness. |
| **4 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.** | Divine Intelligence counts and names each thought, giving every idea its right order and purpose. |
| **5 Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.** | Infinite Understanding governs all; nothing escapes its design. |
| **6 The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.** | Humility rises; pride collapses.  The meek are drawn upward into alignment, while self-exaltation returns to dust. |
| **7 Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God.** | Gratitude tunes the heart like a harp; thanksgiving becomes the music of renewed consciousness. |
| **8 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.** | He regulates inspiration and expression — sending clouds of contemplation, rain of insight, and growth upon every height of thought. |
| **9 He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.** | Even the instinctual and the dark, unanswered parts of being receive their portion; nothing in the self is forgotten. |
| **10 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.** | Divine Joy is not in human effort or natural force but in yielded trust.  Self-will cannot move Spirit. |
| **11 The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.** | The Lord delights in reverence and quiet expectancy — the soul resting in mercy, not performance. |
| **12 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.** | Inner Jerusalem, give thanks; consciousness established in Zion (alignment) celebrates the indwelling God. |
| **13 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.** | The boundaries of thought are fortified with truth; every inner faculty is blessed with peace. |
| **14 He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.** | Equilibrium reigns; divine nourishment fills the understanding with the substance of truth. |
| **15 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.** | The Divine Idea moves instantly through consciousness, accomplishing its purpose without delay. |
| **16 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.** | He reveals purity even in stillness; cold intellect is softened, and rigidity becomes gentle insulation for new growth. |
| **17 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?** | The mind that resists warmth of Spirit becomes frozen; none can stand until grace melts the heart. |
| **18 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.** | The living Word releases the frozen places; understanding melts, the Spirit moves, and truth flows freely again. |
| **19 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.** | Revelation returns: the aspiring self (Jacob) receives instruction; the awakened identity (Israel) lives by inner law. |
| **20 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.** | This intimacy belongs to the inner man.  Only the renewed soul knows the joy of divine governance.  Therefore, praise the Lord! |
