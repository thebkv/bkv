# Job 1

---



## **BKV (Bible Key Version)**

1. There was a state of **material consciousness** called **Uz**, within which resided a state of being named **Job**. And this aspect of the self was complete and upright, and it held **reverence** for the **Absolute Source**, and it turned away from inner **separation**.
2. And there were born to it **seven perfect inner faculties** and **three spiritual intuitions**.
3. Its inner worth was also **seven thousand pure thoughts**, and **three thousand thoughts of a higher nature**, and **five hundred acts of power**, and **five hundred acts of humble service**, and a vast inner environment; so that this aspect of the self was the most developed of all those in the consciousness of the **rising sun**.
4. And its **inner faculties** would go and dwell in their own distinct states of being, each in its appointed time, and they would invite their **three spiritual intuitions** to commune with them.
5. And it came to be, when the cycle of their inner feasting was complete, that the **Job** consciousness would cleanse them and rise early, offering up a sense of divine union for each one, for the **Job** consciousness said, "It may be that my **inner faculties** have become estranged, and have cursed the **Absolute Source** in their deepest thoughts." Thus did the **Job** consciousness do this continually.
6. Now there was a day when the principles of the **Absolute Source** came to align themselves before its divine will, and also the force of **fragmentation and opposition** came among them.
7. And the **Absolute Source** said to this force, "From where do you come?" Then the force of **fragmentation** answered, "From going to and fro in the **inner earth** of human consciousness, and from walking up and down in it."
8. And the **Absolute Source** said to the force of **fragmentation**, "Have you considered that aspect of my being, **Job**, that there is none like it in the **inner earth** of human consciousness, a complete and upright state of being, one that holds a deep **reverence** for the **Absolute Source** and turns away from inner **separation**?"
9. Then the force of **fragmentation** answered the **Absolute Source**, and said, "Does the **Job** consciousness hold **reverence** for nothing?
10. Have You not created an inner hedge of protection about it, and about all its faculties, and about all that it has on every side? You have blessed the work of its actions, and its inner worth has increased in the consciousness of the **inner earth**."
11. "But now, just reach forth and touch all that it has, and it will surely turn against You to Your face."
12. And the **Absolute Source** said to the force of **fragmentation**, "Behold, all that it has is in your power; only upon its own core consciousness do not lay your hand." So the force of **fragmentation** went forth from the presence of the **Absolute Source**.
13. And there came a day when its **seven faculties** and **three intuitions** were communing in their eldest faculty’s state of being;
14. And there came an inner message to the **Job** consciousness, saying, "Your powerful acts were at work, and your acts of humble service were present with them:
15. And sudden, worldly thoughts fell upon them and took them away; they have slain the inner services with the sword of worldly consequence; and only I, the essence of the message, have escaped to tell you."
16. While that message was yet speaking, another inner message came, saying, "The consuming **fire** of divine testing has come from the heavens of consciousness, and has burned up the **pure thoughts** and the inner services, and consumed them; and only I, the essence of the message, have escaped to tell you."
17. While he was yet speaking, another inner message came, saying, "Thoughts of **false, worldly identity** formed three groups, and fell upon the **thoughts of a higher nature**, and have taken them away, and slain the inner services with the sword; and only I, the essence of the message, have escaped to tell you."
18. While he was yet speaking, another inner message came, saying, "Your **inner faculties** and **intuitions** were communing in their eldest faculty's state of being:
19. And behold, a great **wind of change** came from the wilderness of the unknown, and struck the four corners of that inner dwelling, and it fell upon the **young faculties**, and they are spiritually dead; and only I, the essence of the message, have escaped to tell you."
20. Then the **Job** consciousness arose, and its outer garment of identity was torn, and its head of pride was humbled, and it fell upon the ground of inner reality and surrendered to the divine,
21. And said, "Naked of all worldly attachment I came out of my mother's womb of consciousness, and naked shall I return to it. The **Absolute Source** gave, and the **Absolute Source** has taken away; blessed be the name of the **Absolute Source**."
22. In all this, the **Job** consciousness did not fall into inner **separation**, nor did it accuse the **Absolute Source** with a foolish mindset.

## **Original Text: Job 1 (King James Version)**

1. There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.
2. And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
3. His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
4. And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
5. And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
6. Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them.
7. And the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
8. And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?
9. Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
10. Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
11. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
12. And the Lord said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.
13. And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
14. And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:
15. And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
16. While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
17. While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
18. While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
19. And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
20. Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,
21. And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.
22. In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

### **Interpretive Summary**

The Book of Job is an ancient play, and a profound psychological and spiritual drama about the relationship between the **natural man** and the **Absolute Source** in the face of suffering. **Job** represents a state of being—the **natural man** (from the land of **Uz**) who is externally righteous and successful but has not yet been tested at the core of his being. He has built a life on material and external blessings, represented by his sons, daughters, and vast possessions.

The central conflict between God and Satan can also be understood to be the **Divine Will** and the force of **fragmentation and opposition** (often personified as **Satan**). This "force" is the part of human consciousness that doubts the authenticity of spiritual life that has not been truly tested. It argues that a person's faith is merely a transaction: obedience for blessings. The **Absolute Source** allows the test to proceed, but with one crucial condition: the core of the **Job** consciousness itself must remain untouched. This signifies that while external circumstances and even inner faculties can be shaken, the true, essential self is inviolable.

The rapid loss of Job's children and possessions symbolizes the swift and complete destruction of the external and internal supports on which the natural man's life is built. His **sons and daughters** represent the beloved inner faculties and intuitions of his mind. The **oxen and camels** are his acts of service and his higher thoughts. The **wind from the wilderness** and the **fire from heaven** are the unpredictable and purifying forces of divine change that dismantle his carefully constructed life.

The chapter culminates in **Job's** ultimate act of surrender. By tearing his garments and falling to the ground, he lets go of his external identity and pride. His famous words, "Naked I came... naked shall I return," signify his realization that his true identity is not found in possessions or even in the faculties of his mind, but in his unadorned, essential self. He does not accuse the **Absolute Source**, thereby passing the initial test. This sets the stage for the rest of the book, which will explore the deeper theological questions that arise when the natural man’s comfortable, righteous existence is challenged.
