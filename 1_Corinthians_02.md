# 1 Corinthians 2 — BKV Study (The Principle of Divine Revelation)
### *Where Human Wisdom Ends, the Spirit Begins*

---

> _“And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.”_ — 1 Corinthians 2:4 KJV
> _“But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.”_ — 1 Corinthians 2:14 KJV

*In this chapter, the Apostle lifts the veil from intellect itself, revealing that wisdom is not a ladder to the Divine, but a mirror through which only the Spirit may shine. The **Core Truth** cannot be comprehended by the **Intellectual Faculty**; it is unveiled by the **Creative Impulse**—the **Spirit of Life**—which alone communicates the **Eternal Source’s** hidden purpose.*

## **BKV-NR Context — The Rejection of Self-Generated Wisdom**

**1 Corinthians 2** continues the **Principle of Singular Foundation** (Ch. 1), now defining the method by which Divine instruction descends. The Apostle declares that the message was not delivered through persuasive rhetoric or **Human Wisdom**—the method favored by the **Intellectual Faculty (Greeks)**—but through the **demonstration of Power** proceeding from the **Creative Impulse**.

Thus the chapter divides all knowing into two orders: that which is **natural** (discerned by the unassisted mind) and that which is **spiritual** (discerned only through Divine Revelation). The first is forever blind to the second.

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**  

### **The Rejection of Human Wisdom**

1. And I, **Structure (Paul)**, when I came to you, came not with superiority of **Eloquence** or of **Human Wisdom**, declaring unto you the **Core Truth** of the **Eternal Source**.
4. And my message and my teaching were not with persuasive arguments of **Human Wisdom**, but in **Demonstration** of the **Creative Impulse (Spirit)** and of **Power**:
5. That your **Core Truth (faith)** should not rest in the power of **Human Wisdom**, but in the **Power of the Source**.
7. But we speak the **Source’s Wisdom** in a **Mystery** (hidden truth)—even the **Principle of Divine Purpose** which the **Eternal Source** ordained before the manifestation of the domains unto our **Glory**.

### **The Process of Revelation**

10. But the **Source** has **revealed** them unto us by His **Creative Impulse (Spirit of Life)**: for the **Creative Impulse** searches all things, yea, the **Profound Depths** of the Source.
12. Now we have received not the **Impulse of the Manifested Domain** (spirit of the world), but the **Creative Impulse** which is of the **Source**, that we might **know** the things freely given unto us by the **Eternal Source**.

### **Spiritual Discernment**

14. But the **Natural Man** (unassisted consciousness) **receiveth not** the things of the **Creative Impulse** of the Source: for they are **Folly** unto him; neither can he **know** them, because they are **Spiritually Discerned**.
15. But he that is **Spiritual** (governed by the Creative Impulse) **discerneth** all things, yet he himself is **discerned** by no **Natural Man**.
16. For who hath known the **Mind of the Source**? But **we have the Mind of the Principle of Divine Humanity.**

## **Commentary on the Action**

### **1 · The Power of Demonstration (vv 4–5)**
The **Core Truth** must be proclaimed not through persuasion but through **Power**—that living operation of the **Creative Impulse**. This ensures that faith rests not upon eloquence or intellectual mastery but upon the inner witness of the Spirit. It dissolves the factions of Chapter 1, where loyalty to orators (Apollos, Cephas, Paul) divided the believers by personality rather than Presence.

### **2 · The Creative Impulse as the Key to Mystery (vv 7, 10)**
The **Source’s Wisdom** is a **Mystery**—a concealed architecture of **Divine Purpose**. It cannot be deduced by the **Natural Mind**, for logic cannot scale the Infinite. Only the **Creative Impulse**, which searches the **Depths of the Source**, can unveil this structure within consciousness. Revelation is not discovery—it is descent.

### **3 · The Impotence of the Natural Man (v 14)**
The **Natural Man**, bound to the **Manifested Domain**, cannot apprehend the **Core Truth**. To him, the things of God appear as **Folly**, for he measures the Infinite with the tools of the finite. **Spiritual Discernment** arises only when the **Creative Impulse** governs the faculties, converting intellect into instrument and mind into sanctuary.

## **Core BKV Principle**
> *Where the intellect ends, revelation begins. The **Core Truth** is not learned but received; not reasoned but revealed. The **Natural Man** is blind to it, for **Spiritual Discernment** is born only of the **Creative Impulse**, the living Power of the **Eternal Source**.*
