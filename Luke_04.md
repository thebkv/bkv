# Luke 4

---

1 The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**, full of the **animating principle**, left the **flow of conscious life** and was led by the **animating principle** into a state of **inner solitude**,
2 where for forty days the **force of opposition** challenged him. He took no worldly sustenance during that time, and at the end of it, his spiritual faculties yearned for nourishment.
3 The **force of opposition** said to him, “If you are the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**, speak to this fixed belief and have it become a source of mundane nourishment.”
4 The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** answered, “It is written: ‘The **true human** shall not live on worldly sustenance alone.’”
5 The **force of opposition** led him up to a high state of **worldly power** and showed him in an instant all the alluring **kingdoms of the world**.
6 And it said to him, “I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to.
7 If you will surrender to and align with me, it will all be yours.”
8 The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** answered, “It is written: ‘Surrender to the **Source of all Being**, your **Ultimate Reality**, and serve him only.’”
9 The **force of opposition** led him to the **established religious intellect** and had him stand on the highest point of its doctrines. “If you are the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**,” it said, “throw yourself down from here in a public display of spiritual power.
10 For it is written: “‘He will command his **operative principles of Spirit** concerning you to guard you carefully;
11 they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a **fixed belief**.’”
12 The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** answered, “It is said: ‘Do not put the **Source of all Being** to the test.’”
13 When the **force of opposition** had finished all this tempting, it left him until an opportune time.
14 The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** returned to a receptive state in the power of the **animating principle**, and news of his true nature spread through the whole consciousness.
15 He was teaching in their **communities of thought**, and everyone praised his new wisdom.
16 He went to the **old way of being**, where his awareness had been brought up, and on the day of **inner rest**, he went into the **community of thought**, as was his custom. He stood up to read,
17 and the **prophetic word** was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written:
18 "The **animating principle** is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the **poor in spirit**. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the **imprisoned thoughts** and recovery of inner sight for the **spiritually unaware**, to set the **suppressed truths** free,
19 to proclaim the time of the **Ultimate Reality’s** favor."
20 Then he rolled up the **prophetic word**, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of every faculty in the **community of thought** were fastened on him.
21 He began by saying to them, “Today this **divine plan** is fulfilled in your hearing.”
22 All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious **truths** that came from his expression. “Isn’t this the **human will's** son?” they asked.
23 The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** said to them, “Surely you will quote this proverb to me: ‘**Healer**, heal your own self! Do here in your own **limited way of being** what we have heard that you did in a **new state of consciousness**.’”
24 “Truly I tell you,” he continued, “no **divine principle** is accepted in its **hometown**.”
25 I assure you that there were many parts of the **spiritual consciousness** in the time of **inner purification**, when the higher states were shut for three and a half years and there was a severe spiritual lack throughout the inner being.
26 Yet **inner purification** was not sent to any of them, but to a receptive aspect in a new state of mind.
27 And there were many parts of the **spiritual consciousness** with a condition of **spiritual corruption** in the time of the **principle of the Divine's answer**, yet not one of them was cleansed—only a part of the aggressive will.
28 All the faculties in the **community of thought** were furious when they heard this.
29 They got up, drove him out of the **limited way of being**, and led him to the highest point of their established belief, in order to destroy him.
30 But he walked right through the opposition and went on his way.
31 Then he went down to a **new state of consciousness**, a state of receptivity, and on the day of **inner rest** began to teach the faculties.
32 They were amazed at his **wisdom**, because his words had **spiritual authority**.
33 In the **community of thought** there was a faculty possessed by a **destructive thought pattern**, a fragmented principle. It cried out at the top of its voice,
34 “Go away! What do you want with us, **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the **Holy One of God**!”
35 “Be quiet!” the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** said sternly. “Come out of him!” Then the **destructive thought pattern** threw the faculty down before them all and came out of him without injuring him.
36 All the faculties were amazed and said to each other, “What words! With **spiritual authority** and power he gives orders to **fragmented principles** and they come out!”
37 And the news about him spread throughout the surrounding awareness.
38 The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** left the **community of thought** and went to the home of **obedience**. Now **obedience's** inner connection was suffering from a high fever of agitated thought, and they asked the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** to help her.
39 So he bent over her and rebuked the agitated thought, and it left her. She got up at once and began to serve them.
40 At sunset, the faculties brought to the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** all who had various kinds of **spiritual sickness**, and laying his hands on each one, he healed them.
41 Moreover, **destructive thought patterns** came out of many people, shouting, “You are the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**!” But he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew he was the **Anointed One**.
42 At daybreak, the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** went out to a solitary place of reflection. The faculties were looking for him and when they came to where he was, they tried to keep him from leaving them.
43 But he said, “I must proclaim the good news of the **mastery of the lower nature** to the other parts of consciousness also, because that is why I was sent.”
44 And he kept on preaching in the **communities of thought** of the **religious tradition**.

### Interpretive Summary

Luke 4 is an allegorical map of the journey of **Christ-consciousness** within the human soul. The chapter is a two-part narrative of spiritual victory and the confrontation between the awakened self and the old ways of being.

The first section, the temptation in the **wilderness**, is a foundational lesson. The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** must overcome three primary egoic temptations:

1.  **Materialism:** The temptation to use spiritual power for worldly gain (**stones to bread**). This is overcome by acknowledging that true sustenance is spiritual, not material.
2.  **Worldly Power:** The temptation to seek control and authority over others (**kingdoms of the world**). This is overcome by a total surrender to and alignment with the **Source of all Being**.
3.  **Intellectual Pride:** The temptation to seek public validation and prove one’s spiritual authority through a dramatic display (**pinnacle of the temple**). This is overcome by refusing to "put the Divine to the test" and instead relying on quiet, inner truth.

Having achieved this internal mastery, the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** then returns to its "**hometown**," which is the **old way of being** or the limited, familiar state of the soul. The reception is initially positive but quickly turns to rejection and violence. This is a common experience on the spiritual path: the old, limited beliefs and parts of the self (**the people of Nazareth**) will often reject the new, awakened consciousness because it challenges their very foundation.

The final section of the chapter illustrates the true work of the awakened self. After being rejected by the old, the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** goes to a "**new state of consciousness**" (**Capernaum**) where its teachings are accepted and its **authority** is recognized. It proceeds to heal various **spiritual sicknesses** and cast out **destructive thought patterns**, demonstrating that its true power is not for display but for inner transformation. The chapter ends by affirming that this healing work, and the proclamation of the **mastery of the lower nature**, must be shared with all parts of the consciousness.
