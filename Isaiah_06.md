# Isaiah 6 — BKV (Traditional Layout)
## *The Vision of the True King, the Cleansing of the Inner Man, and the Birth of a Calling*

---

## **Summary**
Isaiah 6 is the turning point of the entire book.  
After the collapse (ch. 3), cleansing (ch. 4), and explanation of misalignment (ch. 5), Isaiah 6 reveals what happens when the **inner eye opens** and encounters the **Presence of God**.

The movement of the chapter:

1. **A throne vision** — the soul beholds the True King (v.1–4).  
2. **A crisis of identity** — Isaiah sees his own brokenness (v.5).  
3. **A purification** — the burning coal touches the lips (vv.6–7).  
4. **A calling** — “Whom shall I send?” (v.8).  
5. **A paradoxical mission** — speak to a people who will not listen (vv.9–10).  
6. **A final hope** — the holy seed in the stump (v.13).

Isaiah 6 describes nothing less than the **birth of a prophet** inside the soul — the awakening of a deeper spiritual faculty.

# **Isaiah 6 — KJV / BKV Comparison Table**

| Verse | KJV Text | BKV (Bible Key Version) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | “In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.” | When the old inner king (**Uzziah** = strength of the flesh; self-sufficiency) collapses, the soul finally beholds the **True King**. God appears “high and lifted up” — not because He changed, but because the inner eye has cleared. His presence fills the entire temple (the inner life). |
| **2** | “Above it stood the seraphims… with six wings…” | **Seraphim** (“burning ones”) represent the forces of purification and illumination. Their wings symbolize reverence (covering face), humility (covering feet), and action directed by God alone (flying). |
| **3** | “And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy… the whole earth is full of his glory.” | The cry of the seraphim reveals the **triple holiness** — God’s nature in fullness. “The whole earth is full of His glory” means every part of life, every experience, every faculty, is capable of reflecting God when rightly seen. |
| **4** | “And the posts of the door moved… and the house was filled with smoke.” | God’s presence shakes the very **thresholds** of the inner life. The “smoke” symbolizes mystery — the sense of the sacred that exceeds human comprehension. |
| **5** | “Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone…” | Encountering God produces a crisis: Isaiah sees his fragmentation (“undone”). His confession is symbolic: **unclean lips** = unclean speech, thought, and intention — the expression of a misaligned heart. |
| **6** | “Then flew one of the seraphims… having a live coal… from off the altar.” | A burning coal from the **altar** represents divine truth applied personally. It is not a concept; it is a **transforming encounter**. |
| **7** | “And he laid it upon my mouth… thy iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.” | The deepest part of Isaiah — his speech, his self-expression, his inner voice — is purified. Sin (misalignment) is not excused; it is **burned away**. |
| **8** | “Also I heard the voice of the Lord… Whom shall I send?… Then said I, Here am I; send me.” | Isaiah hears his **calling** arise from within the Presence. There is no coercion. God asks a question, and Isaiah’s newly awakened self answers with freedom, clarity, and willingness. |
| **9–10** | “Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not…” | Isaiah’s mission is paradoxical: speak to a people whose hearts are resistant. Spiritually, this symbolizes how truth is first spoken into parts of ourselves that cannot yet receive it — until we break and soften. |
| **11** | “Lord, how long?”… | Isaiah voices the universal cry of the called soul: *How long will misalignment persist?* |
| **12** | “Until the LORD have removed men far away…” | Misaligned states must be cleared out. The soul undergoes interior exile before awakening can fully take root. |
| **13** | “But yet in it shall be a tenth… as a teil tree, and as an oak… so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.” | The final image is stunning: even after devastation, a **holy seed** remains inside the stump. This seed is the indestructible life of God within the soul — the beginning of rebirth. |

# **BKV Final Conclusion: The Birth of a Prophet in the Soul**

Isaiah 6 shows what happens when the inner life finally beholds the Holy:

- The **false king dies.**  
- The **True King is revealed.**  
- The soul is **undone**, then **purified**, then **commissioned**.  
- And even in the places of ruin, God leaves a **holy seed** — the beginning of a new creation.

This chapter is the spiritual pattern for every calling:  
**vision → conviction → cleansing → willingness → mission → hope.**
