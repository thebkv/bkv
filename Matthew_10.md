## Matthew 10 (BKV Fully Symbolic Restatement)

1. Jesus called to him his twelve **sent ones**, and gave them **heaven-backed authority** over **unclean forces**, to cast them out and to heal every **disease** and every **affliction**.  

2. The names of the twelve **sent ones** are these: first, **Hearing (Simon)**, who is called **Rock (Peter)**, and **Manly (Andrew)** his brother; **Supplanter (James)** son of **Gift of God (Zebedee)**, and **Yahweh is Gracious (John)** his brother;  

3. **Lover of Horses (Philip)** and **Son of Furrows (Bartholomew)**; **Twin (Thomas)** and **Gift of Yahweh (Matthew)** the **debt-collector**; **Supplanter (James)** son of **Change (Alphaeus)**, and **Heart (Thaddaeus)**;  

4. **Hearing (Simon)** the **Burning with Zeal (Zealot)**, and **Praise (Judas)** Iscariot, who betrayed him.  

---

5. Jesus sent out these twelve, instructing them: “Do not go among the **nations** or enter into the towns of the **foreigners (Samaritans)**,  

6. but go rather to the **lost sheep of the Struggling Ones (Israel)**.  

7. And proclaim as you go, saying, ‘The **Reign of Heaven** has drawn near.’  

8. Heal those **in need of healing spiritually**, raise the **cut off and hopeless**, cleanse the **separated ones**, cast out **unclean forces**. Freely you received; freely give.  

9. Acquire no gold or silver or copper for your belts,  

10. no bag for the journey, or two tunics, or sandals, or staff; for the **worker** deserves his food.  

11. Whatever **city** or **village** you enter, find who in it is **worthy**, and stay there until you depart.  

12. As you enter the **inner world**, greet it.  

13. If the **inner world** is **worthy**, let your **peace** rest upon it; but if it is not **worthy**, let your **peace** return to you.  

14. And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the **dust of your feet** when you leave that **inner world** or **town**.  

15. Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable on the day of **judgment** for **Burning (Sodom)** and **Submersion (Gomorrah)** than for that **town**.  

---

16. “Behold, I am sending you as **sheep among wolves**; so be wise as **serpents** and innocent as **doves**.  

17. Beware of people, for they will deliver you over to **councils** and flog you in their **assemblies of exclusion (synagogues)**,  

18. and you will be dragged before **governors** and **kings** for my sake, to bear witness before them and the **nations**.  

19. When they deliver you over, do not be anxious about how you are to **speak** or what you are to **say**, for what you are to **say** will be given to you in that hour.  

20. For it is not you who **speak**, but the **Spirit of your Father** speaking through you.  

---

21. Brother will deliver brother to **death**, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to **death**.  

22. You will be hated by all for my **name’s sake**. But the one who **endures** to the end will be **saved**.  

23. When they persecute you in one **town**, flee to the next, for truly, you will not have gone through all the **towns of the Struggling Ones** before the **Reborn Humanity** comes.  

---

24. A **disciple** is not above his **teacher**, nor a **servant** above his **master**.  

25. It is enough for the **disciple** to be like his **teacher**, and the **servant** like his **master**. If they called the **master of the inner world** **Prince of Forces (Beelzebul)**, how much more will they malign those of his **inner world**!  

---

26. “So have no fear of them, for nothing is **covered** that will not be **revealed**, or **hidden** that will not be **known**.  

27. What I tell you in the **dark**, say in the **light**, and what you hear **whispered**, proclaim on the **housetops**.  

28. Do not fear those who **kill** the body but cannot **kill** the soul. Rather, fear the one who can destroy both soul and body in **Valley of Burning Refuse (Gehenna)**.  

29. Are not two **sparrows** sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your **Father**.  

30. Even the **hairs of your head** are all numbered.  

31. Fear not, therefore; you are of more **value** than many **sparrows**.  

---

32. So everyone who **acknowledges** me before others, I also will **acknowledge** before my **Father** who is in **heaven**,  

33. but whoever **denies** me before others, I also will **deny** before my **Father** who is in **heaven**.  

---

34. “Do not think that I have come to bring **peace** to the earth. I have not come to bring **peace**, but a **sword**.  

35. For I have come to set a **man** against his **father**, and a **daughter** against her **mother**, and a **daughter-in-law** against her **mother-in-law**.  

36. A person’s **enemies** will be those of his own **inner world**.  

---

37. Whoever loves **father** or **mother** more than me is not **worthy** of me; and whoever loves **son** or **daughter** more than me is not **worthy** of me.  

38. Whoever does not take up his **cross (way of surrender)** and follow me is not **worthy** of me.  

39. Whoever finds his **life (self-preservation)** will **lose** it, and whoever **loses** his **life** for my sake will **find** it.  

---

40. “Whoever **receives** you **receives** me, and whoever **receives** me **receives** him who sent me.  

41. The one who **receives** a **prophet** because he is a **prophet** will **receive** a **prophet’s reward**, and the one who **receives** a **righteous person** because he is righteous will **receive** a **righteous person’s reward**.  

42. And whoever gives one of these **little ones** even a cup of **cold water** because he is a **disciple**, truly, I say to you, he will by no means **lose** his **reward**.”
