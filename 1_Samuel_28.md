# 1 Samuel 28 — The Principle of False Inquiry  
### *The Silence of God and the Desperation of the Will*

> _“And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.”_  
> — **1 Samuel 28 : 6 KJV**

## **BKV-NR — Narrative Reading**

### **I. The Silence of Heaven (vv 1–6)**  

The Philistines gathered for war. David was dwelling in Ziklag, hidden;  
but Saul stood alone. He enquired of the Source, yet heard no answer—  
neither through dreams, nor Urim, nor prophets.  

*When the outer will has rejected light too often,  
the channels of revelation fall silent.*  

---

### **II. The Search for Forbidden Counsel (vv 7–11)**  

Saul said to his servants, > “Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit.”  
They found one in **Endor (Spring of Generation).**  
He disguised himself and went by night.  

He said to the woman, > “Bring me up Samuel.”  

*The will, unable to rise to the Source, attempts to reach backward through the psychic realm—  
a forbidden reversal of spiritual order.*  

---

### **III. The Disturbance of the Past (vv 12–15)**  

When the woman saw Samuel, she cried aloud,  
for she perceived Saul.  
And Samuel said, > “Why hast thou disquieted me?”  

Saul answered, > “I am sore distressed; the Philistines make war against me,  
and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more.”  

*False inquiry disturbs memory rather than receives revelation.  
The past cannot give what only the living Spirit can speak.*  

---

### **IV. The Prophecy of Inevitable End (vv 16–19)**  

Samuel said, > “Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee and is become thine enemy? …  
Tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me.”  

Saul fell full length on the ground.  

*The word of truth, when summoned through fear, condemns rather than comforts.  
Judgment is not inflicted by God but drawn forth by disobedience.*  

---

### **V. The Kindness of the Witch (vv 20–25)**  

The woman saw Saul trembling and bade him eat.  
She brought him bread and a calf, and he ate and departed that night.  

*Even in error, there remains a trace of mercy;  
compassion mingles with judgment as the will fades into darkness.*

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Samuel 28** reveals the **Law of False Inquiry**—  
the futility of seeking spiritual answers through inverted means.

- **Saul** represents the egoic will estranged from the Source, turning to substitute channels.  
- **Endor** is the psychic well of human imagination—spiritual power misdirected into the past.  
- **The Woman** is mediumistic sensitivity without illumination.  
- **Samuel** is the echo of truth, not its living voice.  

When the heart cannot endure silence, it turns to noise.  
But the silence it feared was itself the door to renewal.

## **Addendum — The Law of False Inquiry**

When the voice of Spirit is silent, wait.  
To seek answers through fear is to speak into an empty mirror.  
True guidance returns only to a heart at rest.  
Better the night of silence than the whisper of illusion.

## **Core BKV Principle — 1 Samuel 28**

> fear turns it into illusion.** 🕊️

### *The Silence and the Shadow*

---

28 : 1–6  
The enemy rose, and I sought the Source,  
but heard nothing—no dream, no word, no sign.  
The heavens were still.  
My own breath echoed in the emptiness.  
I feared the silence and called it abandonment.  

---

28 : 7–11  
Then I said within my fear, “Find me a voice.”  
And they brought me to a well of shadows.  
I disguised my need as strength and whispered, “Bring me Samuel.”  
But I summoned only memory, not revelation.  

---

28 : 12–19  
The past rose and spoke, “Why disquiet me?”  
And I answered, “Because I am afraid.”  
The echo replied, “You knew the truth and left it.”  
So the light I had once known condemned my own departure.  

---

28 : 20–25  
I fell to the ground, trembling.  
A woman of pity fed me bread.  
Even error offered mercy,  
for compassion lingers where judgment falls.  
And I went my way into the night,  
bearing the weight of unanswered prayer.  

---

### **Meditative Reflection**

> When God is silent, wait.  
> To force an answer is to raise a shadow.  
> Better the long quiet than the false voice,  
> for truth will speak again when the heart is still.
