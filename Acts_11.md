## BKV-NR (Natural Reading)

2. And when **The Principle of the Rock (Peter)** was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the **Principle of Rigid Spiritual Law (The Circumcision)** contended with him,
3. Saying, “You went in to **Unconsecrated Aspects** and did eat with them.”
4./ But **The Principle of the Rock** rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded it by order unto them...
15. And as I began to speak, the **Principle of Divine Energy (Holy Ghost)** fell on them, as on us at the beginning.
17. Forasmuch then as **The Self-Existent Reality** gave them the **Like Gift** as **He** did unto us, who believed on the **Christ Principle**; what was I, that I could **Withstand The Self-Existent Reality**?
18. When they heard these things, they held their peace, and **Glorified The Self-Existent Reality**, saying, “Then has **The Self-Existent Reality** also to the **Unconsecrated Aspect of Consciousness** granted **Repentance** unto **Inner Life**.”

### The New Center of Growth

19. Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about **The First Martyr (Stephen)** travelled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and **The Principle of Expansion (Antioch)**, preaching the **Divine Utterance** to the **Aspects of the Soul** only.
21. And the **Principle of the Self-Existent Reality (Hand of the Lord)** was with them: and a great number **Believed**, and **Turned** unto the **Christ Principle**.
22. Then news of these things came unto the ears of the **Church Principles** which were in Jerusalem: and they sent forth **The Principle of Encouragement (Barnabas)**, that he should go as far as **The Principle of Expansion**.
24. For he was a **Good Principle**, and full of the **Principle of Divine Energy** and of **Inner Trust**: and much **Aspect of the Soul** was added unto the **Christ Principle**.
26. And the **Principles of the Disciples** were called **Christians** first in **The Principle of Expansion**.

### Foresight and Action

28. And there stood up one of them named **The Principle of Prophetic Foresight (Agabus)**, and signified by the **Divine Energy** that there should be **Spiritual Scarcity (Great Dearth)** throughout all the **Inner World**: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.
29. Then the **Principles of the Disciples**, every **Aspect of the Soul** according to his **Inner Ability**, purposed to send **Relief** unto the **Aspects of the Soul** which dwelt in Judaea.

## Commentary on the Action

Acts 11 records the **inner-soul contention** that occurs when the **Principle of the Rock (Peter)** breaks the **Principle of Rigid Spiritual Law (The Circumcision)** by bringing the **Divine Energy** to the **Unconsecrated Aspect of Consciousness (Gentiles)**. This spiritual breakthrough is validated because the **Principle of Divine Energy** falls upon the Gentiles exactly as it did upon the early Jewish Principles, proving **Universal Access**.

The action then shifts to **The Principle of Expansion (Antioch)**, which becomes the new hub of growth where the **Principles of the Disciples** are first named after the **Christ Principle (Christians)**. The chapter closes by highlighting the role of the **Principle of Prophetic Foresight (Agabus)**, which warns of future **Spiritual Scarcity**, prompting the **Aspects of the Soul** to proactively prepare and share inner **Relief**.

## Interpretive Insights

**I.1. The Contention of the Rigid Principle (v. 2-3, 17):** The **Principle of Rigid Spiritual Law** (The Circumcision) represents the conservative, established, and often fearful part of the consciousness that resists any change to the *modus operandi*. Peter's defense is a psychological breakthrough: the **Principle of the Rock** realizes that he is not in a position to **"withstand The Self-Existent Reality"** when the **Divine Energy** clearly moves past the established boundaries. This marks the soul's necessary submission of **Ritual** to **Grace**.

**I.2. Antioch and the Naming of the Self (v. 21, 26):** **The Principle of Expansion (Antioch)** is the inner region of the soul where the **Unconsecrated Aspect of Consciousness** is integrated with the **Christ Principle**. The fact that the Principles were first called **"Christians"** there signifies that this inner region is the first place where the soul's **identity** fully aligns with the **Christ Principle**, moving past an identity based on the **Law** ("Jew") or the **External World** ("Gentile").

**I.3. Foresight and Proactive Action (v. 28-29):** The inclusion of **Agabus** and the **Famine** serves as a vital psychological lesson: **Spiritual Scarcity** (a lack of the Word/Energy) is an inevitable future condition in the **Inner World**. The **Principle of Prophetic Foresight** exists to warn the soul not to be passive. The appropriate action is the proactive sharing of inner **Relief** (spiritual resources) between the expanding and the established parts of the soul, ensuring that **Generosity** is prepared *before* the **Drought** arrives.

## Note on KJV Verse 27

The KJV verse 27 reads: **"And in those days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch."**

This verse is not explicitly listed in the BKV-NR section but is **contained in the introduction to verse 28**, as the prophets' arrival is the direct precursor to Agabus's action.

The BKV-NR line that encapsulates the *arrival of the prophetic principles* is within the BKV-NR for verse 28:

> And there stood up **one of them** named **The Principle of Prophetic Foresight (Agabus)**...

**BKV-NR for KJV 11:27 (Conceptual):** The arrival of the prophets represents the arrival of the **Principles of Prophetic Discernment**—the faculties capable of interpreting future spiritual patterns. The **Principle of Expansion (Antioch)** is now advanced enough to receive these higher prophetic insights from the center of established truth (Jerusalem).
