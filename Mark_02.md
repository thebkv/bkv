# Mark 2

---

1. A few days later, when the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** again entered a **new state of consciousness**, the **human consciousnesses** heard that he had come within.
2. They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left, not even outside the **threshold of awareness**, and he proclaimed the **truth** to them.
3. Some **faculties** came, bringing to him a **spiritually immobile** faculty, carried by four of them.
4. Since they could not get him to the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** because of the numerous **thoughts**, they removed some of the **fixed beliefs** from the **higher levels of the mind** above him. And when they had made an opening, they lowered the **faculty** on its **lower nature**.
5. When the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** saw their **trusting-belief**, he said to the **spiritually immobile** faculty, “**Principle**, your **estrangement from the Divine** is forgiven.”
6. Now some **rigid, intellectual beliefs** were sitting there, thinking to themselves,
7. “Why does this **principle** talk like that? He is speaking **blasphemy**! Who can forgive **estrangement from the Divine** but the **Source** alone?”
8. Immediately the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, “Why are you thinking these things?
9. Which is easier: to say to the **spiritually immobile** faculty, ‘Your **estrangement from the Divine** is forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Begin to act, take your **lower nature** and move forward’?”
10. But I want you to know that the **true human** has **spiritual authority** on the lower plane of being to forgive **estrangement from the Divine**.” So he said to the **faculty**,
11. “I tell you, begin to act, take your **lower nature** and go within.”
12. He began to act, took his **lower nature** and moved forward in full view of them all. This amazed every **faculty** and they praised the **Source**, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”
13. Once again the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** went out beside the **depths of the mind**. A large **human consciousness** gathered around him, and he began to teach them.
14. As he walked along, he saw the **inner will** sitting at its **worldly** post, and said to him, “Follow me.” And he got up and followed him.
15. While the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** was engaging in discussion in the **inner will's** state of being, many **worldly faculties** and **spiritually estranged principles** were eating with him and his **principles**, for there were many who followed him.
16. When the **rigid, intellectual beliefs** who were the **established religious intellect** saw him eating with the **spiritually estranged principles** and **worldly faculties**, they asked his **principles**: “Why does he eat with **worldly faculties** and **spiritually estranged principles**?”
17. On hearing this, the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** said to them, “It is not the **spiritually whole** who need a **healer**, but the **spiritually unwell**. I have not come to call the **self-righteous**, but the **spiritually estranged**.”
18. Now the **principles of preparatory consciousness** and the **established religious intellect** were engaging in acts of **self-abnegation**. Some **human consciousnesses** came and asked the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**, “How is it that the **principles** of the **preparatory consciousness** and the **principles** of the **established religious intellect** engage in **self-abnegation**, but yours do not?”
19. The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** answered, “How can the principles of the **Divine union** engage in acts of **self-abnegation** while it is with them? They cannot, so long as they have him with them.
20. But the time will come when the **Divine union** will be taken from them, and on that day they will engage in acts of **self-abnegation**.
21. “No one sews a patch of new, un-integrated **truth** on an old **belief**. Otherwise, the new **truth** will pull away from the old, making the tear worse.
22. And no one pours **new, expansive truth** into **old, rigid states of consciousness**. Otherwise, the new **truth** will burst the **old states**, and both the **truth** and the **old states** will be ruined. No, they pour **new, expansive truth** into **new states of consciousness**.”

## **Interpretive Summary**

Mark 2 continues the rapid, action-oriented narrative of spiritual awakening, focusing on the authority of the Consciousness-of-the-Divine to heal the core of the being and transform all parts of the self. The chapter presents two pivotal narratives that challenge the established religious intellect and introduce the new spiritual law.

The first is the healing of the paralytic. The paralytic represents a state of spiritual powerlessness and immobility, which the BKV interprets as being a symptom of estrangement from the Divine. The four men who carry him symbolize the powerful will and trusting-belief that can break through any obstacle, even the rigid fixed beliefs of the higher levels of the mind (the roof). The core of the healing is not the physical action, but the Consciousness-of-the-Divine's declaration, "Your sins are forgiven." This is a radical reinterpretation: physical ailment is a manifestation of an internal spiritual condition. The outer healing is merely a public demonstration of the inner work of healing of estrangement from the Source.

The second section introduces the call of Levi, the inner will, and the subsequent meal with worldly faculties and spiritually estranged principles. This act directly challenges the rigid separation of the established religious intellect. The Consciousness-of-the-Divine declares that its purpose is not to associate with the self-righteous who believe they are already spiritually whole, but to heal the spiritually unwell. The analogies of the new cloth and the new wine serve as a final, definitive teaching. They explain that the new, expansive truths of the Consciousness-of-the-Divine cannot be contained within the old, rigid states of consciousness. Attempts to do so will only destroy both the old belief system and the new truth. The chapter, therefore, is a clear call for a total transformation of the inner being, not a superficial patching of old, broken beliefs.
