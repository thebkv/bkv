# Matthew 5:43–48 — BKV Study  
### *The Transfiguration of the Inner Enemy*

> **KJV**  
> “Ye have heard that it hath been said,  
> *Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.*  
> But I say unto you,  
> *Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you,  
> and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;*  
> That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven:  
> for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good,  
> and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.  
> For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?  
> And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?  
> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.”  
> — *Matthew 5:43–48 KJV*

## BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)

Jesus overturns the old patterns of the natural mind.  
The former way taught the soul to divide life into **friends** and **enemies**,  
and to love only where it felt safe or understood.

But the **Christ-Mind** gives a new command:  
**Love even the parts of life that oppose you.**  
Bless the forces that speak against you.  
Do good toward the impulses within that once wounded you.  
Pray for the memories and individuals that injured you.

For this is how the **Father** acts:  
His **light** rises on every region of the soul—  
the noble impulses and the broken ones,  
the faithful thoughts and the straying ones.  
His **rain** softens every hardened ground,  
that all inner land may become fruitful again.

To love only the agreeable parts of life is natural;  
to love the hostile parts is divine.  
This is how the true child of the Father is known:  
not by selective affection,  
but by **unlimited benevolence**.

“Be therefore **perfect**,” Jesus says—  
complete, whole, undivided—  
as your Father is whole,  
whose love flows without measurement or fear.

## BKV–DR (Deep Reading / Symbolics)

### “Ye have heard… but I say unto you”  
Marks the transition from **external law** to **internal illumination**.  
The soul moves from *behavior management* to *identity transformation*.

### “Love your enemies”  
In BKV terms, **enemies** represent:

- painful memories  
- inner reactions  
- adversarial impulses  
- people who mirror our unpurified states  
- the unresolved forces of the lower nature  

Loving them means **refusing to keep the old divisions alive**.

### “Bless them that curse you”  
**Cursing** = the inner voices that condemn, shame, accuse.  
**Blessing** = speaking from the Christ-Mind into the places where old patterns speak death.

### “Do good to them that hate you”  
**Hate** often represents the negating force—the instinct that pushes life away.  
Doing good means meeting negation with generosity, not recoil.

### “Pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you”  
These are the persecuting **inner narratives**:  
stories that chase, define, or reduce you.  

**Prayer** here is the **reorientation of awareness**—  
lifting the persecuted place into God’s presence until it dissolves.

### “That ye may be the children of your Father…”  
Sonship is not proven by belief but by transformation.  
The Father’s likeness appears in the soul only when love flows  
where it once would have defended itself.

### “He maketh his sun… he sendeth rain…”  
- **Sun** = illumination, clarity, divine intelligence.  
- **Rain** = mercy, softening, nourishment.

God pours both onto every part of the inner world—  
even the unhealed places.  
To imitate the Father is to stop withholding goodness.

### “If ye love them which love you…”  
The natural man loves selectively.  
The spiritual man loves **from essence**, not preference.

### “Be ye therefore perfect…”  
**Perfect** = *Teleios* — complete, integrated, whole.  
Not flawless, but **undivided**:  
a heart no longer split between mercy and resentment.

Perfection here is not moral achievement—  
it is **the healed heart**, patterned after the Father’s oneness.
