4. Then said Principle of Worldly Judgment to the Chief Inner Ministers and to the Principles of the Multitude, “I find no fault in this Principle.”

13. And Principle of Worldly Judgment called together the Chief Inner Ministers and the Principles of the Rulers and the Multitude,
14. Saying, “You have brought this Principle to me, as one that subverts the Aspects of the Soul: and I, having examined Him before you, have found no fault in this Principle.”
18. And the whole Multitude of Principles cried out at once, saying, “Away with this Principle, and release to us Barabbas (The Unredeemed Lower Self)!”

## Commentary on the Action

Luke 23 details the final, fatal action of the unregenerate ego against its Divine potential. The Christ Principle, after being judged by Worldly Judgment (Pilate) and ridiculed by Sensual Curiosity (Herod), is exchanged for the Unredeemed Lower Self (Barabbas). The journey to the Highest Point of Intellectual Cessation (Golgotha) is the path of Total Self-Naughting. The core allegorical lessons involve the forgiveness of the executors (the ignorant parts of the soul), the two responses of condemned principles (Reproach vs. Conversion), the permanent dissolution of the Veil of Separation, and the burial of the Spiritual Remains in the Undefiled Part of the Soul, awaiting resurrection.


## Interpretive Insights

I.1. The Failure of Inner Authority (Luke 23:1-16): The Christ Principle is handed over for judgment to the highest two faculties of the Natural Mind: Pilate (Judicial Conscience) and Herod (Sensual Curiosity). Pilate, though finding no fault, lacks the moral courage to defy the "mob" (base thoughts/principles). Herod represents the desire of the lower mind to experience the divine sensationally, without commitment, resulting in mockery. This shows that the Christ Principle is rejected not by ignorance, but by the willful cowardice and frivolousness of the soul's own highest unregenerate powers.
I.2. The Choice of Barabbas (Luke 23:18-25): This is the soul’s self-condemnation. The Unredeemed Lower Self (Barabbas), defined by rebellion and destruction (sedition/murder), is explicitly chosen over the Christ Principle. This signifies the ego's powerful, deep-seated choice to preserve its most cherished vice or self-destructive pattern (the robber/murderer) at the expense of Divine Life. Worldly Judgment (Pilate) succumbs to the pressure of the inner mob (the clamoring base thoughts).
I.3. The Principle of Conversion on the Cross (Luke 23:39-43): The two thieves symbolize the two outcomes of the condemned, lower parts of the soul during self-sacrifice. The Principle of Reproach rebels until the end. The Principle of Conversion accepts the judgment as just and turns to the Christ Principle. The promise "Today you shall be with me in Paradise" means that genuine, final acceptance of the Christ Principle during the process of self-crucifixion leads to the immediate return to the pristine, higher state of consciousness.
