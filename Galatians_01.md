# Galatians 1 — The Gospel That Cannot Be Altered
### *Revelation Over Regulation — The Christ Within and Not Without*

| **Authorized (KJV)** | **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)** |
|:--|:--|
| **1.** Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;) | **Enlightened Will (Paul)** speaks—not from hierarchy or institution, but from direct **Revelation through the Living Christ**, raised from the realm of dead forms into awakened life. |
| **2.** And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia: | With every allied faculty of the soul, he addresses **Galatia — the emotional realm**: once aflame with faith, now flickering under doubt. |
| **3.** Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, | Every divine motion begins in **Grace** and resolves in **Peace**—the twin harmonies of the renewed mind. |
| **4.** Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: | The **Christ within** continually offers Himself to redeem thought from the inverted patterns of the outer world—lifting the soul into alignment with Divine Intention. |
| **5.** To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. | Glory belongs not to effort but to **The Source itself**, from whom every true order descends. |
| **6.** I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: | The **heart of Galatia**, once radiant in liberty, now drifts toward **Another Gospel**—the mind’s attempt to improve upon grace through form and rule. |
| **7.** Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. | Yet truth has no rival. Those “some” are inner distortions—self-exalting thoughts that twist revelation into regulation and trouble simplicity. |
| **8.** But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. | Even if **lofty reasoning (angel from heaven)** proclaims a modified gospel, it falls under its own separation—for every distortion of grace isolates itself from harmony. |
| **9.** As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. | The decree repeats: let no thought divide the undivided truth. Grace cannot be improved—only received. |
| **10.** For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. | The **Ego of Approval** is the final idol to fall. The true servant of Christ acts from **Alignment**, not applause. |
| **11.** But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. | The inner message springs not from intellect but from divine disclosure. It arrives whole, not reasoned. |
| **12.** For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. | Revelation is the **flash of knowing**—the Christ within teaching the soul directly from its own center. |
| **13.** For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: | The former zeal of **Saul** represents the mind enslaved to order and prestige. In its blindness, devotion becomes destruction. |
| **14.** And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. | Zeal without illumination multiplies bondage. Tradition without revelation exalts memory over life. |
| **15.** But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace, | Then came divine pleasure—the **birth from material awareness (“mother’s womb”)** into spiritual identity—summoned purely by **Grace**. |
| **16.** To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: | The unveiling of **the Son within** is redemption itself. Having seen, the soul seeks no external validation; it turns inward to listen. |
| **17.** Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. | **Arabia** is the silent wilderness where revelation ripens in solitude; **Damascus (“well-watered”)** the return of vision into fruitful action. |
| **18.** Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. | After a full cycle of inner completion, consciousness ascends to **Jerusalem — the City of Peace**, joining **Faith (Peter)** for a season of balance and grounding. |
| **19.** But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother. | He communes also with **Wisdom (James)**—the faculty of practical understanding that steadies revelation. |
| **20.** Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. | The enlightened will bears witness before Spirit itself: truth spoken from direct knowing needs no defense. |
| **21.** Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; | The journey continues through **Syria (“highland”)** and **Cilicia (“shaken”)**—higher awareness still learning stability. |
| **22.** And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: | The new consciousness is not yet outwardly recognized by the older structures of faith—it moves unseen. |
| **23.** But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. | The mind that once opposed truth now proclaims it—the power of reversal when pride yields to light. |
| **24.** And they glorified God in me. | The final evidence of redemption: others behold not the man but the **Indwelling Glory** shining through him. |

### **Summary Principle**

The soul must not trade **revelation for religion**.  
Grace, once awakened, must remain free.  
When the **Son is revealed in you**, every structure of fear and pride collapses.  
The Gospel cannot be improved—it can only be realized.  
Grace does not evolve; it reveals.
