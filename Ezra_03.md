# Ezra 3 — BKV-NR (Tuned)

1 When the seventh month had come, and the children of Israel were in their towns, the people gathered as one man to **Foundation of Peace**.  

2 Then **Yahweh saves (Jeshua)** the priest, with his brothers, and **Seed of Babylon (Zerubbabel)** the son of Shealtiel with his brothers, arose and built the **altar — the place of surrender and offering** — of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the **instruction of Drawn Out (Moses)**, the man of God.  

3 They set the **altar** in its place, for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the lands, and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, morning and evening.  

4 And they kept the **Feast of Booths — remembrance of God’s dwelling with his people in the journey** — as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the rule, as each day required.  

5 And afterward the regular burnt offering, and the offerings at the new moons, and at all the appointed feasts of the LORD, and the offerings of everyone who made a freewill offering to the LORD.  

6 From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD. But the **foundation — the grounding of divine presence in consciousness —** of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.  

7 So they gave money to the masons and carpenters, and food, drink, and oil to the people of **Rock (Tyre)** and **Hunting (Sidon)**, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the grant that they had from **Sun / Furnace (Cyrus)**, king of Persia.  

8 Now in the second year after their coming to the house of God at **Foundation of Peace**, in the second month, **Seed of Babylon (Zerubbabel)** and **Yahweh saves (Jeshua)** and the rest of their brothers — the priests, the Levites, and all who had come to **Foundation of Peace** from captivity — began the work. They appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to supervise the work of the house of the LORD.  

9 And **Yahweh saves (Jeshua)** with his sons and brothers, and Kadmiel with his sons, and the sons of Henadad, with their sons and brothers, the Levites, stood together to supervise those who worked on the house of God.  

10 When the builders laid the **foundation** of the temple of the LORD, the priests in their vestments came forward with **trumpets — proclamations of divine truth with clarity**, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with **cymbals — joyful resonance of praise**, to praise the LORD, according to the directions of **Beloved (David)** king of Israel.  

11 And they sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to the LORD:  
“For he is good, for his steadfast love endures forever toward Israel.”  

And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the LORD, because the **foundation of the house of the LORD** was laid.  

12 But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ houses, old men who had seen the first house, wept with a loud voice when they saw the **foundation** of this house being laid, though many shouted aloud for joy,  

13 so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shout from the sound of the people’s weeping. For the people shouted with a great shout, and the sound was heard far away.
