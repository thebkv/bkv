## BKV-NR (Natural Reading)

1 And when the **Time of Spiritual Completion** came, and the **Aspects of the Soul** were in their **Inner States**, the people gathered together as one **Inner Intention** to **Foundation of Peace**.
2 Then stood up **Jeshua (Yahweh Saves)** and **Zerubbabel (Principle of Seed/Generation)**, and they built the **Principle of Sacrifice** of the **Source** of **Spiritual Identity**, to offer **Continuous Dedication** upon it, as it is written in the **Law of Moses (Divine Law)**.
3 And they set the **Principle of Sacrifice** upon its **spiritual foundation** (for **Fear** was upon them because of the **Principles of the Land**), and offered **Continuous Dedication** morning and evening.
4 They also kept the **Feast of Divine Manifestation (Tabernacles)**, as it is written, with the corresponding daily **Dedication**.
5 And afterward they offered the **Dedicated Offering** and the offerings of the new **Inner Cycles** and all the offerings of the **Willingly Dedicated**.
6 From the first day of the **Time of Spiritual Completion** they began to offer **Continuous Dedication** to the **Source**. But the **Foundation of the Inner Temple** was not yet laid.
7 They gave **resources** to the **inner workers**, and **sustenance** to the **Inner Service Principles**, to bring **materials** from **The World** to **Foundation of Peace**, according to the **decree** of **Cyrus (The External Will)**.
8 Now in the second **Inner Cycle** of their coming to the **Foundation of Peace**, the rebuilding began. And **Jeshua** and **Zerubbabel** appointed the **Inner Service Principles** to supervise the **Work of the Inner Temple**.
9 Then stood **Inner Joy** and his sons and brethren, and the **Inner Service Principles**, as **overseers** to the **Inner Builders** in the **Work of the Source**.
10 And when the **Inner Builders** laid the **Core Spiritual Structure** of the **Inner Temple**, they set the **Inner Ministers** in their **robes** with **Inner Music** to praise the **Source**, according to the **ordinance** of **David (Principle of Divine Love)**.
11 And they sang, praising and giving thanks to the **Source**, because **His Inner Goodness** is continuous and **His Enduring Mercy** toward **Spiritual Identity**.
12 But many of the **Memory of the Past** wept with a loud voice when they saw the **Core Spiritual Structure** of this **Inner Temple** laid, because they had seen the **glory** of the first **Inner Temple**.
13 So the **Aspects of the Soul** could not discern the **sound of the shouting of joy** from the **sound of the weeping** of the **Memory of the Past**.

2.  Then stood up **Principle of Salvation** and his **brethren the Inner Ministers**, and **Principle of Seed/Generation** and his **brethren**, and built the **Principle of Sacrifice** of the **Source** of **Spiritual Identity**, to offer **Continuous Dedication** thereon, as it is written in the **Divine Law**.

4.  They kept also the **Feast of Divine Manifestation**, as it is written, and offered the daily **Continuous Dedication** by **measure**, according to the **custom**, as the **duty** of every **cycle** required;
5.  And afterward offered the **continual Continuous Dedication**, and the **Offerings** of the new **Inner Cycles**, and of all the **set feasts** of the **Self-Existent Reality** that were **consecrated**, and of every **Aspect of the Soul** that willingly **offered** a **freewill offering** unto the **Self-Existent Reality**.
6.  From the first **cycle** of the **Time of Spiritual Completion** began they to offer **Continuous Dedication** unto the **Self-Existent Reality**. But the **Core Spiritual Structure** of the **Inner Temple** was not yet laid.
7.  They gave **resources** also unto the **Inner Builders**, and to the **Inner Workers**; and **sustenance**, and **inner oil**, unto them of **Inner Purity**, and to them of **Inner Strength**, to bring **materials** from **Inner Height** to the **Sea of Inner Experience**, according to the **grant** that they had of **The External Will**, king of **The World**.
8.  Now in the second **cycle** of their coming unto the **Inner Temple** of the **Source** at **The Inner State of Peace**, in the second **Inner Cycle**, began **Principle of Seed/Generation** and **Principle of Salvation**, and the **rest of their brethren** the **Inner Ministers** and the **Inner Service Principles**, and all they that were come out of the **Bondage** unto **The Inner State of Peace**; and appointed the **Inner Service Principles**, from twenty **cycles** and upward, to set forward the **Work of the Inner Temple**.

And all the **Aspects of the Soul** shouted with a great **shout**, when they **praised** the **Self-Existent Reality**, because the **Core Spiritual Structure** of the **Inner Temple** was laid.
12. But many of the **Inner Ministers** and **Inner Service Principles** and **chief ancestral faculties**, who were the **Memory of the Past**, that had seen the **first Inner Temple**, when the **Core Spiritual Structure** of this **Inner Temple** was laid before their **inner sight**, wept with a loud **voice**; and many shouted aloud for **joy**:
13. So that the **Aspects of the Soul** could not discern the **noise** of the **shout of Vigor of New Hope** from the **noise** of the **weeping** of the **Memory of the Past**: for the **Aspects of the Soul** shouted with a **loud shout**.


## Commentary on the Action

Ezra 3 provides the blueprint for spiritual restoration *after* the initial return. It teaches that the **Principle of Sacrifice (the Altar)** must be rebuilt and actively used *before* the **Core Spiritual Structure (Foundation)** is laid. The soul cannot effectively rebuild its structure until it has recommitted to **continuous self-dedication and worship**. The **Seventh Month** marks this as an action of **spiritual completion**. The scene is finished by highlighting the **dual emotional reality** of restoration: the grief for the past self (Old Men Weeping) must coexist with the vigorous hope for the new self (Young Men Shouting).

## Interpretive Insights

**I.1. Altar Before Temple (Ezra 3:2-3, 6):** This is the soul's critical first step. The **Principle of Sacrifice/Worship (Altar)** must be established and activated through **Continuous Dedication (daily burnt offerings)** *before* the **Core Spiritual Structure (Temple Foundation)** is laid. The external structure of belief must wait for the internal commitment to self-giving. This is done even when **Fear** of surrounding worldly principles is present.

**I.2. The Symbolic Calendar (Ezra 3:1, 4):** The work begins in the **Seventh Month (Tishri)**, the month of **Spiritual Rest and Completion**. This signifies that the work of restoration is initiated only after the previous cycles of judgment and purification (Bondage) are deemed complete. The subsequent observance of the **Feast of Tabernacles** marks the soul's commitment to living by **Divine Manifestation** and trusting the Source in the wilderness of the world.

**I.3. The Dual Emotion (Ezra 3:12-13):** The **Old Men Weeping** symbolize the **Memory of the Past** (the inner sense that remembers the "glory" of the former, simpler, unfallen spiritual state). The **Young Men Shouting** symbolize the **Vigor of the New Hope**. Restoration is complete only when the **grief for the lost self** and the **joy for the new potential** exist simultaneously and are interwoven in the soul's response.
