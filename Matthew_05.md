#Matthew05

## Chapter 5 Key Notes
- **Jesus** — Name means “Yahweh Saves” (*Matthew 1:21*). For readability, we use “Jesus” in the text from this chapter forward.  
- **Mountain → Elevated State of Mind** — Symbol of vision and teaching (*Exodus 19, Matthew 5:1*).  
- **Blessed (Makarios)** — Divinely favored, aligned with God’s rule.  
- **Poor in Spirit → Aware of their Need** — Recognition of dependence on God.  
- **Mourn → Recognize Loss or Sin** — Awareness that leads to comfort (*Isaiah 61:2–3*).  
- **Meek → Surrendered Strength** — Gentle trust in God, strength under control (*Psalm 37:11*).  
- **Hunger and Thirst for Righteousness → Deep Longing for God’s Justice**.  
- **Merciful → Extending Grace**.  
- **Pure in Heart → Unmixed Devotion**.  
- **Peacemakers → Those Who Reconcile**.  
- **Persecuted for Righteousness → Opposed for Alignment with God’s Will**.  
- **Salt → Preserving Influence, covenant loyalty** (*Leviticus 2:13*).  
- **Light → Divine Revelation, witness** (*Isaiah 60:1, John 8:12*).  
- **Gehenna → Destruction** — Valley of Hinnom, symbol of ruin (*Jeremiah 7:31*).  
- **Righteousness → Alignment with God’s Will**, deeper than outward law-keeping.

## Matthew 5 (BKV Symbolic-Only Restatement)

1. Seeing the crowds, Jesus went up into _the_ **Elevated State of Mind**, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him.  

2. He opened his mouth and taught them, saying:  

3. **Divinely Favored** are those **Aware of their Need**, for theirs is _the_ **Reign of Heaven**.  

4. **Divinely Favored** are those who **Recognize Loss or Sin**, for they shall be comforted.  

5. **Divinely Favored** are those of **Surrendered Strength**, for they shall inherit the earth.  

6. **Divinely Favored** are those with a **Deep Longing for God’s Justice**, for they shall be filled.  

7. **Divinely Favored** are those who **Extend Grace**, for they shall receive grace.  

8. **Divinely Favored** are those of **Unmixed Devotion**, for they shall see God.  

9. **Divinely Favored** are those who **Reconcile**, for they shall be called sons of God.  

10. **Divinely Favored** are those **Opposed for Alignment with God’s Will**, for theirs is _the_ **Reign of Heaven**.  

11. **Divinely Favored** are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.  

12. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.  

13. You are _the_ **Preserving Influence of the Earth**; but if this influence loses its savor, how shall it be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.  

14. You are _the_ **Light of the World**. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.  

15. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.  

16. So let your **Light** shine before others, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.  

17. Do not think I came to abolish _the_ **Law or the Prophets**; I did not come to abolish but to fulfill.  

18. Truly, until heaven and earth pass away, not one jot or tittle shall pass from _the_ **Law** until all is accomplished.  

19. Whoever relaxes one of the least commandments and teaches others to do so will be called least in _the_ **Reign of Heaven**; but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great.  

20. For unless your **Alignment with God’s Will** surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter _the_ **Reign of Heaven**.  

21. You have heard it said, “Do not murder”; but I say to you that everyone angry with his brother will be liable to judgment.  

22. Whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; whoever says “You fool” will be liable to _the_ fire of **Destruction**.  

23. If you bring your gift to the altar and remember your brother has something against you,  

24. leave your gift, go, first be reconciled, then come and offer your gift.  

25. Make peace quickly with your accuser while you are on the way, lest the accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be thrown into prison.  

26. Truly, you will not get out until you have paid the last penny.  

27. You have heard it said, “Do not commit adultery.”  

28. But I say to you that everyone who looks with lust has already committed adultery in his heart.  

29. If your right eye causes you to stumble, tear it out and throw it away; it is better to lose one member than for your whole body to be cast into **Destruction**.  

30. And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away; for it is better to lose one member than for your whole body to go into **Destruction**.  

31. It was said, “Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate.”  

32. But I say to you that everyone who divorces, except for sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.  

33. Again you have heard it said, “Do not swear falsely, but perform your oaths to the Lord.”  

34. But I say to you, do not swear at all — neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne,  

35. nor by earth, for it is his footstool, nor by _the_ **City of Peace**, for it is the city of the Great King.  

36. Do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.  

37. Let your word be simply Yes or No; anything more comes from _the_ **Adversary**.  

38. You have heard it said, “An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.”  

39. But I say to you, do not resist _the_ evil one. If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.  

40. If anyone sues you for your tunic, give him your cloak as well.  

41. If anyone compels you to go one mile, go two with him.  

42. Give to the one who asks, and do not turn away from the one who would borrow.  

43. You have heard it said, “Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.”  

44. But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,  

45. so that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.  

46. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even tax collectors do the same?  

47. And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the nations do the same?  

48. You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
