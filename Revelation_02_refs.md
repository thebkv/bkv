| **1 · To the Church in Ephesus** | **1 · To the State of Consciousness called Ephesus** |
| 1: Unto the **angel** of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the **seven stars** in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the **seven golden candlesticks**; | Unto the <span title="Ref: Revelation 1:20 — “The seven stars…”">**Guiding Principle**</span> of the <span title="Ref: Jeremiah 2:2 — “I remember thee… the love of thine espousals”">**State of Returning to First Love**</span> write: “These things says the One who holds the <span title="Ref: Revelation 1:16 — “He had in his right hand seven stars”">**Seven Guiding Principles**</span> in His <span title="Ref: Isaiah 41:10 — “I will uphold thee with the right hand…”">**Right Hand of Authority**</span>, who walks in the midst of the <span title="Ref: Psalm 119:105 — “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet”">**Seven Principles of Light**</span>: |
| 2: I know thy **works, and labour, and patience**, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are **apostles, and are not**, and hast found them liars: | I know your <span title="Ref: James 2:18 — “Show me thy faith by thy works”">**Disciplined Actions**</span>, your **Labor**, and your <span title="Ref: Hebrews 10:36 — “Ye have need of patience”">**Endurance**</span>, and how you cannot bear those <span title="Ref: 1 John 4:1 — “Try the spirits…”">**thoughts that are false**</span>; and you have tested the claims of those impulses that say they are <span title="Ref: 2 Corinthians 11:13 — “False apostles…”">**Apostolic Principles**</span>, and are not, and you found them wanting. |
| 4: Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because **thou hast left thy first love**. | Nevertheless, I have this against you: you have left your <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:4 — “Thou hast left thy first love”">**First Love**</span>—your original flame of affection for the **Divine Self**. |
| 5: Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the **first works**; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy **candlestick** out of his place, except thou repent. | Remember, therefore, from where you have fallen; return to your <span title="Ref: Luke 10:42 — “One thing is needful…”">**First Conscious Attention**</span>, and do the **Foundational Actions**; or else I will come unto you quickly, and will remove your <span title="Ref: Matthew 25:29 — “Even that he hath shall be taken away”">**Principle of Light Removed**</span> out of its place, unless you return. |
| 7: He that hath an **ear**, let him hear what the **Spirit** saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the **tree of life**, which is in the midst of the **paradise of God**. | He that has <span title="Ref: Matthew 11:15 — “He that hath ears to hear…”">**Spiritual Hearing**</span>, let him hear what the **Spirit** says to the **States of Consciousness**.

I know the slander of the tendency that claims connection with the Inner Covenant, but is governed by the <span title="Ref: Revelation 12:10 — “The accuser…”">**Opposing Impulse**</span>. |
| 10: ...be thou **faithful unto death**, and I will give thee a **crown of life**. | ...Be faithful unto the <span title="Ref: Galatians 2:20 — “I am crucified with Christ”">**Threshold of Death**</span>—the surrender of the **Egoic Will**—and I will give you the <span title="Ref: James 1:12 — “Shall receive the crown of life”">**Crown of Life**</span>. |

| 14: But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the **doctrine of Balaam**...and to hold the **doctrine of the Nicolaitanes**... | But I have a few things against you: you harbor the <span title="Ref: Numbers 31:16 — “Balaam… to commit trespass”">**Teaching of Balaam-Tendency**</span>... and the <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:15 — “Doctrine of the Nicolaitans”">**Teaching of the Nicolaitans**</span>, which works the same corruption. |
| 17: To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the **hidden manna**, and will give him a **white stone** and in the stone a **new name written**... | To the one who overcomes will I give the <span title="Ref: Exodus 16:33 — “Fill an omer… for a memorial”">**Hidden Manna**</span>—inner sustenance—and a <span title="Ref: Isaiah 62:2 — “Thou shalt be called by a new name”">**White Stone**</span> with a <span title="Ref: Revelation 3:12 — “I will write upon him my new name”">**New Name**</span> written on it... |

## **Revelation 2 — BKV Study Commentary**

> _“He that hath an ear, let him hear what the <span title="Ref: John 16:13 — “He will guide you into all truth”">**Spirit**</span> saith unto the churches.”_ — Revelation 2:7

Once the **Divine Self** is unveiled in Revelation 1, the next movement is <span title="Ref: Romans 5:3 — “Tribulation worketh patience”">**inner correction**</span>. Revelation 2 is not spoken to the outer world; it is spoken to the **seven inner states of consciousness**. This is <span title="Ref: Romans 6:14 — “Sin shall not have dominion”">**alignment**</span>. This is the <span title="Ref: John 16:13 — “He will guide you into all truth”">**Spirit**</span> walking among the <span title="Ref: Psalm 119:105 — “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet”">**Principles of Light**</span>, tuning each lamp until the whole soul burns true.

### **The Four States Addressed in Revelation 2**

**1 · Ephesus — The <span title="Ref: Jeremiah 2:2 — “I remember thee… the love of thine espousals”">**State of Returning to First Love**</span>**
The issue is not effort; it is <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:4 — “Thou hast left thy first love”">**motive**</span>. The **Divine Self** calls this state back to its <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:4 — “Thou hast left thy first love”">**First Love**</span> — that primal <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:4 — “Thou hast left thy first love”">**affection**</span> that makes obedience joyful rather than mechanical.

**2 · Smyrna — The <span title="Ref: Acts 14:22 — “Through much tribulation…”">**State of Faith Under Pressure**</span>**
The <span title="Ref: Acts 14:22 — “Through much tribulation…”">**State of Smyrna**</span> faces <span title="Ref: Romans 5:3 — “Tribulation worketh patience”">**pressure**</span>, <span title="Ref: 2 Corinthians 6:10 — “As poor, yet making many rich”">**poverty**</span>, and <span title="Ref: Psalm 142:7 — “Bring my soul out of prison…”">**confinement**</span>. This faculty discovers that the furnace of affliction is the birthplace of the <span title="Ref: James 1:12 — “Shall receive the crown of life”">**Crown of Life**</span> — a consciousness that knows <span title="Ref: Revelation 20:14 — “This is the second death”">**death**</span> cannot undo what God has made alive.

**3 · Pergamum — The <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:13 — “Where Satan’s seat is”">**State of Living Amidst Inner Conflict**</span>**
The <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:13 — “Where Satan’s seat is”">**State of Pergamum**</span> dwells “where the <span title="Ref: Ephesians 6:12 — “Spiritual wickedness…”">**Seat of the Fragmenting Impulse**</span> is.” Its danger is <span title="Ref: Numbers 31:16 — “Balaam… to commit trespass”">**accommodation**</span>. The <span title="Ref: Revelation 3:12 — “I will write upon him my new name”">**promises**</span> are the <span title="Ref: Exodus 16:33 — “Fill an omer… for a memorial”">**Hidden Manna**</span> and the <span title="Ref: Revelation 3:12 — “I will write upon him my new name”">**New Name**</span> — nourishment, <span title="Ref: Isaiah 62:2 — “Thou shalt be called by a new name”">**clarity**</span>, and <span title="Ref: Revelation 3:12 — “I will write upon him my new name”">**identity**</span> untainted by <span title="Ref: Numbers 31:16 — “Balaam… to commit trespass”">**compromise**</span>.

**4 · Thyatira — The <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:19 — “Charity… service… faith…”">**State of Active Love Under Seduction**</span>**
The <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:19 — “Charity… service… faith…”">**State of Thyatira**</span> allows a <span title="Ref: 1 Kings 21:25 — “Jezebel his wife stirred up”">**Seductive Impulse**</span> to function as if it were prophetic. The **Divine Self**, with eyes as a <span title="Ref: Revelation 1:14 — “Eyes as a flame of fire”">**Flame of Fire**</span>, confronts <span title="Ref: 1 Kings 21:25 — “Jezebel his wife stirred up”">**distortion**</span> at its root. The promise is the <span title="Ref: 2 Peter 1:19 — “Day star arise in your hearts”">**Morning Star**</span> — the first light of a <span title="Ref: Jeremiah 17:10 — “Search the heart, try the reins”">**heart**</span> governed by <span title="Ref: Hebrews 4:12 — “Sharper than any two-edged sword”">**truth**</span>.
