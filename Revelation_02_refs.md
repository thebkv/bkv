# Revelation 2  
## *Messages to the Seven States of Consciousness* # BKV Translation

### **1 · To the State of Consciousness called Ephesus**

Unto the <span title="Ref: Revelation 1:20 — “The seven stars…”">**Guiding Principle**</span> of the <span title="Ref: Jeremiah 2:2 — “I remember thee… the love of thine espousals”">**State of Returning to First Love**</span> write:

“These things says the One who holds the <span title="Ref: Revelation 1:16 — “He had in his right hand seven stars”">**Seven Guiding Principles**</span> in His <span title="Ref: Isaiah 41:10 — “I will uphold thee with the right hand…”">**Right Hand of Authority**</span>, who walks in the midst of the <span title="Ref: Psalm 119:105 — “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet”">**Seven Principles of Light**</span>:

I know your <span title="Ref: James 2:18 — “Show me thy faith by thy works”">**Disciplined Actions**</span>, your **Labor**, and your <span title="Ref: Hebrews 10:36 — “Ye have need of patience”">**Endurance**</span>, and how you cannot bear those <span title="Ref: 1 John 4:1 — “Try the spirits…”">**thoughts that are false**</span>; and you have tested the claims of those impulses that say they are <span title="Ref: 2 Corinthians 11:13 — “False apostles…”">**Apostolic Principles**</span>, and are not, and you found them wanting.

You have borne burdens and endured for the sake of My <span title="Ref: John 17:6 — “I have manifested thy name…”">**Name-Principle**</span>, and have not grown weary.

Nevertheless, I have this against you: you have left your <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:4 — “Thou hast left thy first love”">**First Love**</span>—your original flame of affection for the **Divine Self**.

Remember, therefore, from where you have fallen; return to your <span title="Ref: Luke 10:42 — “One thing is needful…”">**First Conscious Attention**</span>, and do the **Foundational Actions**; or else I will come unto you quickly, and will remove your <span title="Ref: Matthew 25:29 — “Even that he hath shall be taken away”">**Principle of Light**</span> out of its place, unless you return.

But this you have: you reject the deeds of the <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:6 — “Which thing I hate”">**Nicolaitan Tendency**</span>—the impulse toward spiritual hierarchy and domination—which I also reject.

He that has <span title="Ref: Matthew 11:15 — “He that hath ears to hear…”">**Spiritual Hearing**</span>, let him hear what the **Spirit** says to the **States of Consciousness**.  
To the one who overcomes, I will grant to eat of the <span title="Ref: Genesis 2:9 — “Tree of life…”">**Tree of Life**</span>—the Principle of Living Union—which is in the <span title="Ref: Luke 23:43 — “Today shalt thou be with me in paradise”">**Inner Paradise**</span> of the **Absolute Source**.”

### **2 · To the State of Consciousness called Smyrna**

Unto the <span title="Ref: Revelation 1:20 — “The seven stars…”">**Guiding Principle**</span> of the <span title="Ref: Acts 14:22 — “Through much tribulation…”">**State of Faith Under Pressure**</span> write:

“These things says the <span title="Ref: Isaiah 44:6 — “I am the first, and I am the last”">**First and the Last**</span>, the One who became as dead and is alive again:

I know your <span title="Ref: Romans 5:3 — “Tribulation worketh patience”">**Inner Pressure**</span>, and your <span title="Ref: 2 Corinthians 6:10 — “As poor, yet making many rich”">**Poverty (yet rich)**</span>—yet you are rich.  
I know the slander of the tendency that claims connection with the **Inner Covenant**, but is governed by the <span title="Ref: Revelation 12:10 — “The accuser…”">**Opposing Impulse**</span>.

Fear none of the things you are about to suffer. Behold, the <span title="Ref: Revelation 12:10 — “The accuser…”">**Adversarial Force**</span> will cast some of you into <span title="Ref: Psalm 142:7 — “Bring my soul out of prison…”">**Inner Confinement**</span>, that you may be tested; and you shall have <span title="Ref: Daniel 1:12 — “Ten days…”">**Tribulation Ten Days**</span>—a complete cycle of pressure.

Be faithful unto the <span title="Ref: Galatians 2:20 — “I am crucified with Christ”">**Threshold of Death**</span>—the surrender of the **Egoic Will**—and I will give you the <span title="Ref: James 1:12 — “Shall receive the crown of life”">**Crown of Life**</span>.

He who has <span title="Ref: Matthew 11:15 — “He that hath ears to hear…”">**Spiritual Hearing**</span>, let him hear what the **Spirit** says to the **States of Consciousness**.  
The one who overcomes shall not be harmed by the <span title="Ref: Revelation 20:14 — “This is the second death”">**Second Death**</span>—the dissolution of the false identity.”

### **3 · To the State of Consciousness called Pergamum**

Unto the <span title="Ref: Revelation 1:20 — “The seven stars…”">**Guiding Principle**</span> of the <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:13 — “Where Satan’s seat is”">**State of Living Amidst Inner Conflict**</span> write:

“These things says the One who has the <span title="Ref: Hebrews 4:12 — “Sharper than any two-edged sword”">**Sharp Two-Edged Sword of Truth**</span>:

I know where you dwell—where the <span title="Ref: Ephesians 6:12 — “Spiritual wickedness…”">**Seat of the Fragmenting Impulse**</span> is.  
Yet you hold fast My <span title="Ref: John 17:6 — “I have manifested thy name…”">**Name-Principle**</span>, and have not denied My <span title="Ref: Revelation 1:5 — “The faithful witness”">**Living Witness**</span>, even in the days of the **Faithful Faculty**, who was pressed to death among you where the **Fragmenting Impulse** resides.

But I have a few things against you: you harbor the <span title="Ref: Numbers 31:16 — “Balaam… to commit trespass”">**Teaching of Balaam-Tendency**</span>—the compromise that entangles consciousness with the lower impulses—and the <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:15 — “Doctrine of the Nicolaitans”">**Teaching of the Nicolaitans**</span>, which works the same corruption.

Return from this compromise; or else I will come unto you quickly, and will fight against these tendencies with the <span title="Ref: Hebrews 4:12 — “Sharper than any two-edged sword”">**Sword of My Mouth**</span>.

He who has <span title="Ref: Matthew 11:15 — “He that hath ears to hear…”">**Spiritual Hearing**</span>, let him hear what the **Spirit** says to the **States of Consciousness**.  
To the one who overcomes will I give the <span title="Ref: Exodus 16:33 — “Fill an omer… for a memorial”">**Hidden Manna**</span>—inner sustenance—and a <span title="Ref: Isaiah 62:2 — “Thou shalt be called by a new name”">**White Stone**</span> with a <span title="Ref: Revelation 3:12 — “I will write upon him my new name”">**New Name**</span> written on it, which no faculty knows except the one who receives it.”

### **4 · To the State of Consciousness called Thyatira**

Unto the <span title="Ref: Revelation 1:20 — “The seven stars…”">**Guiding Principle**</span> of the <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:19 — “Charity… service… faith…”">**State of Active Love Under Seduction**</span> write:

“These things says the **Divine Self**, whose eyes are as a <span title="Ref: Revelation 1:14 — “Eyes as a flame of fire”">**Flame of Fire**</span>, and whose feet are like <span title="Ref: Ezekiel 1:7 — “Colour of burnished brass”">**Burnished Bronze Feet**</span>:

I know your **Love**, your <span title="Ref: James 2:18 — “Show me thy faith by thy works”">**Service**</span>, your **Faith**, your <span title="Ref: Hebrews 10:36 — “Ye have need of patience”">**Endurance**</span>, and that your latter works exceed the first.

Nevertheless, you allow the <span title="Ref: 1 Kings 21:25 — “Jezebel his wife stirred up”">**Seductive Impulse (Jezebel-Tendency)**</span>—symbolized by **Jezebel-Tendency**—which calls itself **Prophetic** but leads the faculties astray, teaching compromise with the lower appetites.

I gave this impulse space to return, but it did not.  
Behold, I will cast it into a <span title="Ref: Hosea 2:6 — “I will hedge up thy way with thorns”">**Bed of Tribulation**</span>, and those tendencies that join with it into pressure, unless they turn from their works.

And the <span title="Ref: James 1:15 — “When lust hath conceived…”">**Offspring of this Impulse**</span>—the patterns it produces—I will bring to an end, and all the **States of Consciousness** shall know that I am the One who searches the <span title="Ref: Jeremiah 17:10 — “Search the heart, try the reins”">**Hearts and Inner Intentions**</span>, and I will give to each faculty according to its works.

But to you who do not hold this teaching, I place no further burden—only hold fast what you have until I come.

To the one who overcomes and keeps My works to the end, I will give <span title="Ref: Romans 6:14 — “Sin shall not have dominion”">**Authority Over the Inner Patternings**</span>; and this one shall rule them with a <span title="Ref: Psalm 2:9 — “Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron”">**Rod of Iron-Principle**</span>, shattering false structures as vessels of clay, even as I have received from My **Absolute Source**.

And I will give this one the <span title="Ref: 2 Peter 1:19 — “Day star arise in your hearts”">**Morning Star**</span>—the dawning of the **Divine Self** within.

He who has <span title="Ref: Matthew 11:15 — “He that hath ears to hear…”">**Spiritual Hearing**</span>, let him hear what the **Spirit** says to the **States of Consciousness**.”

# Revelation 2 — BKV Study
## *The Refinement of the Seven Inner States*

> _“He that hath an ear, let him hear what the <span title="Ref: John 16:13 — “He will guide you into all truth”">**Spirit**</span> saith unto the churches.”_ — Revelation 2:7

Once the **Divine Self** is unveiled in Revelation 1, the next movement is <span title="Ref: Romans 5:3 — “Tribulation worketh patience”">**inner correction**</span>. Revelation 2 is not spoken to the outer world; it is spoken to the **seven inner states of consciousness**. Each receives:

- a commendation,  
- an exposure of distortion,  
- a call to return,  
- and a <span title="Ref: Revelation 3:12 — “I will write upon him my new name”">**promise of renewal**</span>.

This is not punishment.  
This is <span title="Ref: Romans 6:14 — “Sin shall not have dominion”">**alignment**</span>.  
This is the <span title="Ref: John 16:13 — “He will guide you into all truth”">**Spirit**</span> walking among the <span title="Ref: Psalm 119:105 — “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet”">**Principles of Light**</span>, tuning each lamp until the whole soul burns true.

# **The Four States Addressed in Revelation 2**

## **1 · Ephesus — The <span title="Ref: Jeremiah 2:2 — “I remember thee… the love of thine espousals”">**State of Returning to First Love**</span>**
### *Distortion: Doing without <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:4 — “Thou hast left thy first love”">**affection**</span>.* ### *Renewal: Recovered <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:4 — “Thou hast left thy first love”">**motive**</span>.*

The <span title="Ref: Jeremiah 2:2 — “I remember thee… the love of thine espousals”">**State of Ephesus**</span> works hard, discerns well, and <span title="Ref: Hebrews 10:36 — “Ye have need of patience”">**endures faithfully**</span> — yet quietly loses the warmth that once powered everything.  
The issue is not effort; it is <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:4 — “Thou hast left thy first love”">**motive**</span>.

The **Divine Self** calls this state back to its <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:4 — “Thou hast left thy first love”">**First Love**</span> — that primal <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:4 — “Thou hast left thy first love”">**affection**</span> that makes obedience joyful rather than mechanical.

The promise is the <span title="Ref: Genesis 2:9 — “Tree of life…”">**Tree of Life**</span> — the restoration of <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:4 — “Thou hast left thy first love”">**motive**</span> rooted directly in the **Absolute Source**.

**Movement:** From <span title="Ref: James 2:18 — “Show me thy faith by thy works”">**obedience by strength**</span> → to <span title="Ref: James 2:18 — “Show me thy faith by thy works”">**obedience by love**</span>.

---

## **2 · Smyrna — The <span title="Ref: Acts 14:22 — “Through much tribulation…”">**State of Faith Under Pressure**</span>**
### *Distortion: <span title="Ref: Revelation 20:14 — “This is the second death”">**Fear of loss**</span>.* ### *Renewal: Unshakeable <span title="Ref: Hebrews 10:36 — “Ye have need of patience”">**endurance**</span>.*

The <span title="Ref: Acts 14:22 — “Through much tribulation…”">**State of Smyrna**</span> faces <span title="Ref: Romans 5:3 — “Tribulation worketh patience”">**pressure**</span>, <span title="Ref: 2 Corinthians 6:10 — “As poor, yet making many rich”">**poverty**</span>, accusations, and <span title="Ref: Psalm 142:7 — “Bring my soul out of prison…”">**confinement**</span>.  
Everything feels like <span title="Ref: Revelation 20:14 — “This is the second death”">**loss**</span>.

Yet the **Divine Self** says, “You are <span title="Ref: 2 Corinthians 6:10 — “As poor, yet making many rich”">**rich**</span>.”

This faculty discovers that the furnace of affliction is the birthplace of the <span title="Ref: James 1:12 — “Shall receive the crown of life”">**Crown of Life**</span> — a consciousness that knows <span title="Ref: Revelation 20:14 — “This is the second death”">**death**</span> cannot undo what God has made alive.

**Movement:** From **fear of suffering** → to <span title="Ref: Romans 6:14 — “Sin shall not have dominion”">**authority over suffering**</span>.

---

## **3 · Pergamum — The <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:13 — “Where Satan’s seat is”">**State of Living Amidst Inner Conflict**</span>**
### *Distortion: <span title="Ref: Numbers 31:16 — “Balaam… to commit trespass”">**Mixture and compromise**</span>.* ### *Renewal: <span title="Ref: Hebrews 4:12 — “Sharper than any two-edged sword”">**Discernment**</span> and <span title="Ref: Isaiah 62:2 — “Thou shalt be called by a new name”">**clarity**</span>.*

The <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:13 — “Where Satan’s seat is”">**State of Pergamum**</span> dwells “where the <span title="Ref: Ephesians 6:12 — “Spiritual wickedness…”">**Seat of the Fragmenting Impulse**</span> is.”  
This is where the **Mind** is constantly pulled by competing desires and ideas.

Its danger is <span title="Ref: Numbers 31:16 — “Balaam… to commit trespass”">**accommodation**</span> — blending <span title="Ref: Hebrews 4:12 — “Sharper than any two-edged sword”">**truth**</span> with <span title="Ref: Numbers 31:16 — “Balaam… to commit trespass”">**convenience**</span>.

Here, the <span title="Ref: Hebrews 4:12 — “Sharper than any two-edged sword”">**Sword of Truth**</span> must cut cleanly.

The <span title="Ref: Revelation 3:12 — “I will write upon him my new name”">**promises**</span> are the <span title="Ref: Exodus 16:33 — “Fill an omer… for a memorial”">**Hidden Manna**</span> and the <span title="Ref: Isaiah 62:2 — “Thou shalt be called by a new name”">**White Stone**</span> with a <span title="Ref: Revelation 3:12 — “I will write upon him my new name”">**New Name**</span> — nourishment, <span title="Ref: Isaiah 62:2 — “Thou shalt be called by a new name”">**clarity**</span>, and <span title="Ref: Revelation 3:12 — “I will write upon him my new name”">**identity**</span> untainted by <span title="Ref: Numbers 31:16 — “Balaam… to commit trespass”">**compromise**</span>.

**Movement:** From **double-mindedness** → to <span title="Ref: Isaiah 62:2 — “Thou shalt be called by a new name”">**single clarity**</span>.

---

## **4 · Thyatira — The <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:19 — “Charity… service… faith…”">**State of Active Love Under Seduction**</span>**
### *Distortion: <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:19 — “Charity… service… faith…”">**Emotion ungoverned by truth**</span>.* ### *Renewal: <span title="Ref: 2 Peter 1:19 — “Day star arise in your hearts”">**Purified affection**</span>.*

The <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:19 — “Charity… service… faith…”">**State of Thyatira**</span> is full of <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:19 — “Charity… service… faith…”">**love**</span>, <span title="Ref: James 2:18 — “Show me thy faith by thy works”">**service**</span>, <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:19 — “Charity… service… faith…”">**faith**</span>, and <span title="Ref: Hebrews 10:36 — “Ye have need of patience”">**endurance**</span> — yet allows a <span title="Ref: 1 Kings 21:25 — “Jezebel his wife stirred up”">**Seductive Impulse**</span> to function as if it were prophetic.

This is the <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:19 — “Charity… service… faith…”">**emotional life**</span> when it becomes misaligned — <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:19 — “Charity… service… faith…”">**compassion**</span> drifting into <span title="Ref: 1 Kings 21:25 — “Jezebel his wife stirred up”">**flattery**</span>, <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:19 — “Charity… service… faith…”">**kindness**</span> enabling <span title="Ref: 1 Kings 21:25 — “Jezebel his wife stirred up”">**dysfunction**</span>, <span title="Ref: 1 Kings 21:25 — “Jezebel his wife stirred up”">**desire**</span> wearing the mask of <span title="Ref: Hebrews 4:12 — “Sharper than any two-edged sword”">**discernment**</span>.

The **Divine Self**, with eyes as a <span title="Ref: Revelation 1:14 — “Eyes as a flame of fire”">**Flame of Fire**</span>, confronts <span title="Ref: 1 Kings 21:25 — “Jezebel his wife stirred up”">**distortion**</span> at its root.

The promise is the <span title="Ref: 2 Peter 1:19 — “Day star arise in your hearts”">**Morning Star**</span> — the first light of a <span title="Ref: Jeremiah 17:10 — “Search the heart, try the reins”">**heart**</span> governed by <span title="Ref: Hebrews 4:12 — “Sharper than any two-edged sword”">**truth**</span>.

**Movement:** From <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:19 — “Charity… service… faith…”">**feeling as authority**</span> → to <span title="Ref: Hebrews 4:12 — “Sharper than any two-edged sword”">**truth purifying feeling**</span>.

# **Commentary Overview — The Inner Logic of Revelation 2**

### **A. The Pattern**
Each <span title="Ref: Jeremiah 2:2 — “I remember thee… the love of thine espousals”">**inner state**</span> follows the same spiritual rhythm:

1. **Affirmation** — what is already functioning in <span title="Ref: Hebrews 4:12 — “Sharper than any two-edged sword”">**truth**</span>  
2. **Exposure** — the <span title="Ref: 1 Kings 21:25 — “Jezebel his wife stirred up”">**distortion**</span> blocking <span title="Ref: Acts 14:22 — “Through much tribulation…”">**growth**</span>  
3. **Call to return** — the <span title="Ref: Romans 5:3 — “Tribulation worketh patience”">**correction**</span> needed  
4. **Promise** — the <span title="Ref: Revelation 3:12 — “I will write upon him my new name”">**transformation**</span> that follows

This is the anatomy of <span title="Ref: Romans 5:3 — “Tribulation worketh patience”">**spiritual refinement**</span>.

### **B. The Movement from Revelation 1 → 2**
Revelation 1 unveils the **Divine Self** among the <span title="Ref: Psalm 119:105 — “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet”">**Principles of Light**</span>.

Revelation 2 reveals what happens next:  
He begins to speak to each light **individually**.

The movement is from **vision** to <span title="Ref: Romans 6:14 — “Sin shall not have dominion”">**alignment**</span>,  
from **seeing Christ** to **becoming Christ-shaped**,  
from **illumination** to <span title="Ref: Romans 6:14 — “Sin shall not have dominion”">**integration**</span>.

The order matters:

- **Ephesus**: <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:4 — “Thou hast left thy first love”">**motive**</span>  
- **Smyrna**: <span title="Ref: Hebrews 10:36 — “Ye have need of patience”">**endurance**</span>  
- **Pergamum**: <span title="Ref: Isaiah 62:2 — “Thou shalt be called by a new name”">**clarity**</span>  
- **Thyatira**: <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:19 — “Charity… service… faith…”">**affection**</span>  

These are the first four pillars of <span title="Ref: Romans 6:14 — “Sin shall not have dominion”">**inner mastery**</span>.

# **Core BKV Principle for Revelation 2**

> The **Divine Self** addresses each <span title="Ref: Jeremiah 2:2 — “I remember thee… the love of thine espousals”">**inner state**</span>, not to condemn, but to <span title="Ref: Romans 6:14 — “Sin shall not have dominion”">**restore**</span>.  
> The **Will** must <span title="Ref: Revelation 2:4 — “Thou hast left thy first love”">**love again**</span>;  
> **Faith** must <span title="Ref: Hebrews 10:36 — “Ye have need of patience”">**endure**</span>;  
> the **Mind** must <span title="Ref: Hebrews 4:12 — “Sharper than any two-edged sword”">**discern**</span>;  
> the <span title="Ref: Jeremiah 17:10 — “Search the heart, try the reins”">**Heart**</span> must <span title="Ref: 2 Peter 1:19 — “Day star arise in your hearts”">**burn clean**</span>.  
> Revelation 2 is the <span title="Ref: John 16:13 — “He will guide you into all truth”">**Spirit**</span> walking through the **inner sanctuary**, rekindling every lamp until the whole soul shines with <span title="Ref: Romans 6:14 — “Sin shall not have dominion”">**unified light**</span>.
