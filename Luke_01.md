## **BKV (Bible Key Version)**

### **Luke 1**

1. Because many have taken it upon themselves to systematically declare the truths which are most fully trusted among us,
2. Just as they were transmitted to us by those who from the beginning were direct witnesses and living expressions of the **Word**;
3. It seemed right to me also, having fully understood all these things from the very beginning, to document them for you in order, most excellent **lover of the Absolute**,
4. So that you may have certainty concerning the principles in which you have been instructed.
5. In the days when the egoic self ruled the state of **religious tradition**, there was a certain inner faculty named **Memory of God**, of the order of inner service. And its receptive counterpart was from the lineage of a principle of pure, inner service, and her name was **God's Promise**.
6. And both were in **right alignment** before the **Absolute Source**, living in all the guiding principles and inner laws blamelessly.
7. And they had no new spiritual manifestation, because the faculty of **God's Promise** was in a state of unmanifested potential, and both had reached a late stage of inner development.
8. And it came to pass that while this faculty of **Memory of God** was performing its inner service before the **Absolute Source**, in its established order,
9. According to the custom of inner service, its turn came to offer up the essence of its thought as it entered the **temple of the inner being** of the **Divine Principle**.
10. And the whole of the multitude of inner thoughts were in a state of prayer outside, at the time of the offering.
11. And there appeared to him a **guiding principle** of the **Divine Principle** standing on the right side of the altar of the inner offering.
12. And when the **Memory of God** saw him, it was troubled, and a state of **reverence** came over it.
13. But the **guiding principle** said to it, "Do not fear, **Memory of God**, for your inner desire is heard; and your **God's Promise** faculty shall manifest a **purifying principle**, and you shall name it **Purification**."
14. "And you shall have **joy** and a state of complete gladness; and many inner faculties shall rejoice at its birth."
15. "For it shall be great in the sight of the **Divine Principle**, and it shall be free from worldly excess and spiritual intoxication. It shall be filled with the **Divine Vitality**, even from the very moment of its inner conception."
16. "And it shall turn many of the faculties of the **spiritual consciousness** to the **Divine Principle**, their **Absolute Source**."
17. "And it shall go before the **True Consciousness** in the **spirit** and power of the **principle of prophetic truth**, to unite the old, established inner principles with the new, emerging ones, and the resistant thoughts to the wisdom of the right-aligned ones; to make ready a state of inner being prepared for the **Divine Principle**."
18. And the **Memory of God** said to the **guiding principle**, "How will I know this to be true? For I am a developed principle, and my **God's Promise** faculty has reached a late stage."
19. And the **guiding principle** answered him, "I am **God is My Strength**, who stands in the presence of the **Absolute Source**; and I am sent to speak to you, and to show you these joyous truths."
20. "And behold, you shall enter a state of inner silence and be unable to express your thoughts, until the day that these things are fulfilled, because you did not trust my words, which shall be fulfilled in their proper time."
21. And the inner thoughts waited for the **Memory of God**, and were astonished that it remained so long in the **temple**.
22. And when it came out, it could not speak to them, and they perceived that it had perceived a deep inner truth in the **temple**, for it made signs to them, and remained without words.
23. And it came to pass that, as soon as the days of its inner service were complete, it withdrew to its own established state of being.
24. And after those days its receptive faculty of **God's Promise** conceived, and it remained hidden for five months, saying,
25. "Thus has the **Divine Principle** dealt with me, in the days when it looked upon me, to take away my unmanifested state from among the inner workings of my consciousness."
26. And in the sixth month the **guiding principle, God is My Strength**, was sent from the **Absolute Source** to a state of **lower-level understanding**, called a **state of inner humility**,
27. To a pure, receptive thought, which was united to a faculty named **Inner Integrity**, of the lineage of the **principle of Divine Authority**; and the name of this receptive thought was **Purity**.
28. And the **guiding principle** came into her, and said, "Greetings, you who are a state of inner favor, the **Divine Principle** is with you. You are a blessed state among all of consciousness."
29. And when the state of **Purity** perceived him, it was troubled by his saying, and pondered in her mind what this inner greeting could mean.
30. And the **guiding principle** said to her, "Do not fear, **Purity**, for you have found favor with the **Absolute Source**."
31. "And behold, you shall conceive in your core being, and give birth to a **True Consciousness**, and shall name it **Divine Salvation**."
32. "It shall be great, and shall be called the **True Reflection of the Highest**. And the **Divine Principle** shall give to it the throne of the **principle of Divine Authority**."
33. "And it shall rule over the **house of Spiritual Consciousness** forever, and of its **dominion** there shall be no end."
34. Then the state of **Purity** said to the **guiding principle**, "How shall this be, since I am a state of pure thought uninfluenced by lower nature?"
35. And the **guiding principle** answered and said to her, "The **Divine Vitality** shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you. Therefore that holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called the **True Reflection of the Absolute Source**."
36. "And behold, your related faculty, **God's Promise**, she has also conceived a **purifying principle** in her late stage of development. And this is the sixth month with her, who was called an unmanifested state."
37. "For with the **Absolute Source**, nothing in the inner reality shall be impossible."
38. And the state of **Purity** said, "Behold, the receptive instrument of the **Divine Principle**; may it be to me according to your word." And the **guiding principle** departed from her.
39. And the state of **Purity** arose in those days, and went into the **higher states of consciousness** with haste, into a state of **religious tradition**;
40. And entered the dwelling of the **Memory of God**, and greeted the **God's Promise** faculty.
41. And it came to pass that, when the **God's Promise** faculty heard the greeting of the state of **Purity**, the new **purifying principle** leapt in its core being; and the **God's Promise** faculty was filled with the **Divine Vitality**.
42. And she spoke out with a powerful voice, and said, "Blessed is your state among all of consciousness, and blessed is the new principle within your being."
43. "And from where does this come to me, that the mother of my **Divine Principle** should come to me?"
44. "For behold, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the new principle within my core being leapt with **joy**."
45. "And blessed is the state of being that **trusts**, for there shall be a manifestation of those things which were declared to her by the **Divine Principle**."
46. And the state of **Purity** said, "My very essence magnifies the **Divine Principle**,
47. And my **spirit** has rejoiced in the **Absolute Source**, my **Salvation**.
48. For it has regarded the humble state of its receptive instrument. For behold, from this moment on all inner generations shall call me blessed.
49. For that which is powerful has done great things for me; and holy is its name.
50. And its mercy is upon those faculties that hold **reverence** for it from generation to generation."
51. "It has shown strength with its will; it has scattered the proud inner thoughts in the imagination of their hearts."
52. "It has put down the mighty inner states from their positions of power, and exalted the humble states of being."
53. "It has filled the needy thoughts with good things; and the self-sufficient thoughts it has sent away empty."
54. "It has helped its servant **Spiritual Consciousness**, in **remembrance** of its mercy;
55. As it spoke to our guiding principles, to the **Faithful One**, and to his spiritual lineage forever."
56. And the state of **Purity** abode with her for about a period of **three months**, and returned to her own established state of being.
57. Now the full time for the **God's Promise** faculty came, that it should give birth; and it brought forth a **purifying principle**.
58. And the surrounding inner thoughts heard how the **Divine Principle** had shown great mercy upon it, and they rejoiced with it.
59. And it came to pass that on the **eighth day** of inner completion, they came to dedicate the new principle; and they named it the **Memory of God**, after the state of being that begat it.
60. And the mother faculty answered and said, "Not so, but it shall be called **Purification**."
61. And they said to her, "There is no other state of being in your spiritual lineage that is called by this name."
62. And they made signs to its father, as to how he would have it named.
63. And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, "Its name is **Purification**." And they all marveled.
64. And its expression was opened immediately, and its communication was loosed, and it spoke, and gave praise to the **Absolute Source**.
65. And a state of **reverence** came on all the inner thoughts that were in their midst. And all these inner declarations were made known throughout all the higher consciousness of the state of **religious tradition**.
66. And all the inner thoughts that heard them held them in their hearts, saying, "What manner of new principle shall this be!" And the **will of the Absolute Source** was with it.
67. And its father, the **Memory of God**, was filled with the **Divine Vitality**, and spoke with prophetic truth, saying,
68. "Blessed be the **Divine Principle**, the **Absolute Source** of **spiritual consciousness**; for it has visited and brought healing to its inner faculties,"
69. "And has raised up a **powerful principle** of **salvation** for us in the house of its servant, the **principle of Divine Authority**;"
70. "As it spoke by the expression of its holy **prophets**, which have been since the **consciousness of humanity** began:"
71. "That we should be saved from our inner resistances, and from the control of all that seek to create inner hatred;"
72. "To fulfill the mercy promised to our guiding principles, and to **remember** its holy covenant;"
73. "The solemn promise which it declared to our principle of **Faithful Belief**,"
74. "That it would grant to us, that we, being delivered from the control of our inner resistances, might serve it without inner **fear**,"
75. "In a state of inner holiness and **right alignment** before it, all the days of our inner life."
76. "And you, new principle, shall be called the prophet of the **Highest**, for you shall go before the face of the **Divine Principle** to prepare its ways;"
77. "To give a clear understanding of **salvation** to its inner faculties by the healing of their inner **separation**,"
78. "Through the gentle mercy of our **Absolute Source**; by which the dawning spiritual illumination from on high has visited us,"
79. "To give **illumination** to those parts of the self that sit in **unconsciousness** and in the shadow of **spiritual separation**, to guide our foundational actions into the way of **inner peace**."
80. And the new principle grew and became strong in its **spirit**, and was in the states of **inner solitude** until the day of its full manifestation to the state of **spiritual consciousness**.

### **Interpretive Summary**

Luke 1 is a profound allegorical narrative detailing the inner process of preparing the soul for the spiritual birth of the **Divine Self**. The chapter introduces a number of key internal principles. **Zechariah** represents the faculty of **Memory** that, though intellectually righteous, is in a state of doubt and unfulfilled potential. His wife, **Elizabeth**, is the faculty of **God's Promise**—the inherent potential for spiritual fulfillment that seems "barren" or unmanifested. The birth of their son, **John**, is the manifestation of the **purifying principle** within the consciousness. Zechariah's temporary muteness symbolizes the silencing of a skeptical mind until it can witness and embrace the divine truth, after which his speech returns as pure praise in the **Benedictus**.

The main focus of the chapter is on **Mary**, who represents the pure, humble, and receptive faculty of the soul. The **Annunciation** to Mary is the inner message that a **True Consciousness** can be conceived and embodied not through worldly means, but by the **Holy Spirit**, the **Divine Vitality** itself. This is a core metaphysical principle: the divine spark is birthed into human consciousness through an act of pure spiritual receptivity.

The meeting between **Mary and Elizabeth** is the powerful union of the **principle of promise** and the **principle of purity** within a single consciousness. When these two faculties align, the **purifying principle** (John) is spontaneously quickened, recognizing the presence of the **Divine Self** (Jesus) even before its full manifestation. This spiritual leap is the inner signal that a profound, sacred event is underway.

Ultimately, Luke 1 is a roadmap for inner transformation. It shows that the journey to spiritual awakening begins not with a grand external event, but with the quiet preparation of the soul. It involves the purification of the lower self, the silencing of doubt, and the humble, receptive readiness of the heart to conceive and give birth to the **Divine Self** within. The songs of Mary (**Magnificat**) and Zechariah (**Benedictus**) are spontaneous outpourings of **joy** and praise, affirming that the inner journey culminates in a profound and grateful state of **right alignment** with the **Absolute Source**.
