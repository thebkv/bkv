# Exodus 6 — BKV

---  
_“And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.”_
---  

1.  Then the **Ultimate Reality** said to the **Principle of Divine Law**, “Now you shall see what I will do to the **Egoic Will**; for with a **strong inner force** he will let them go; indeed, with a **strong inner force** he will drive them out of his land.”
2.  And the **Ultimate Reality** spoke to the **Principle of Divine Law** and said to him, “I am **The Self-Existent Reality**.”
3.  I appeared to **Spiritual Identity**, to **Principle of Inner Sight**, and to **Integrated Consciousness**, as **Source of all Being**, but by my name **The Self-Existent Reality** was I not known to them.
4.  I have also established my **Core Truth** with them, to give them the land of their **spiritual sojourning**, in which they sojourned.
5.  Moreover, I have heard the groaning of the **Aspects of the Soul**, whom the **Egoic Will** holds in **bondage**, and I have remembered my **Core Truth**.
6.  Say therefore to the **Aspects of the Soul**: ‘I am **The Self-Existent Reality**, and I will **bring you out** from under the **burdens** of the **Egoic Will**, and I will **rid you** of their **bondage**, and I will **redeem you** with an **outstretched power** and with great **spiritual judgments**.
7.  And I will **take you** to me for a **spiritual people**, and I will be your **Source of the Inner Life**, and you shall know that I am **The Self-Existent Reality**, your **Source**, who **brings you out** from under the **burdens** of the **Egoic Will**.
8.  I will bring you into the **realized state** that I swore to give to **Spiritual Identity**, to **Principle of Inner Sight**, and to **Integrated Consciousness**. I will give it to you for a **spiritual inheritance**: I am **The Self-Existent Reality**.’”
9.  **Principle of Divine Law** spoke thus to the **Aspects of the Soul**, but they did not listen to the **Principle of Divine Law**, because of their **shortened spirit** and because of their **harsh bondage**.
10. Then the **Ultimate Reality** spoke to the **Principle of Divine Law**, saying,
11. “Go in, tell the **Egoic Will**, the ruler of the **state of bondage**, to let the **Aspects of the Soul** go out of his land.”
12. But the **Principle of Divine Law** spoke before the **Ultimate Reality**, saying, “Behold, the **Aspects of the Soul** have not listened to me. How then shall the **Egoic Will** listen to me, for I am of **uncircumcised expression**?”
13. But the **Ultimate Reality** spoke to the **Principle of Divine Law** and to the **Principle of Expression** and gave them a **commandment** to the **Aspects of the Soul** and to the **Egoic Will**, to bring the **Aspects of the Soul** out of the **state of bondage**.
14. These are the **spiritual lines of descent** of their ancestral **principles**. The **Aspects of Inner Sight** were **Inner Light** and **Seer** and **Famine**, these are the **families of Inner Sight**.
15. The **Aspects of Hearing** were **Inner Knowing**, and **Spiritual Grief**, and **Discernment**; these are the **families of Hearing**.
16. These are the names of the **Aspects of the Inner Will** according to their **spiritual lines of descent**: **Joined**, and **Inner Self**, and **Uniting**, the **years of the life of the Inner Will** were one hundred and thirty-seven **cycles of experience**.
17. The **Aspects of Joined** were **Sons of the Right Hand**, and **Inner Fortitude**, and **Spiritual Strength**; these are the **families of Joined**.
18. The **Aspects of Inner Self** were **Inner Nobleman** and **Inner Strength**. And the **years of the life of Inner Self** were one hundred and thirty-three **cycles of experience**.
19. The **Aspects of Uniting** were **Inner Simplicity** and **Inner Servant**; these are the **families of Uniting**.
20. **Inner Self** took as his wife his **spiritual faculty**, and she bore him **Principle of Divine Law** and **Principle of Expression**. And the **years of the life of Inner Self** were one hundred and thirty-seven **cycles of experience**.
21. The **Aspects of Joined** were **Inner Devotion** and **Spiritual Strength**.
22. The **Aspects of Inner Strength** took as his wife his **spiritual faculty**, and she bore him **Inner Fire**, these are the **families of Inner Strength**.
23. **Principle of Expression** took as his wife **Daughter of the Wise**, and she bore him **Spiritual Integrity** and **Inner Nobility**.
24. The **Aspects of Inner Simplicity** were **Principle of Divine Blessing** and **Inner Fortitude**, these are the **families of Inner Simplicity**.
25. **Principle of Divine Law** and **Principle of Expression** are the same who said to the **Egoic Will**, “Bring the **Aspects of the Soul** out of the **state of bondage** according to their **spiritual formations**.”
26. It was this **Principle of Divine Law** and this **Principle of Expression** to whom the **Ultimate Reality** said, “Bring the **Aspects of the Soul** out of the **state of bondage**.”
27. These are the same **Principle of Divine Law** and **Principle of Expression** who spoke to the **Egoic Will**.

### Interpretive Insights

**I.1. The Revelation of YHWH (The LORD, Exod 6:3):** The Divine reveals its name as **The Self-Existent Reality (YHWH/JEHOVAH)**, a more profound, personal, and active aspect of the Divine than **Source of all Being (El Shaddai)**. This marks the transition from a distant, powerful source to an intimate, immutable presence actively engaged in the soul’s liberation.

**I.2. The Four Stages of Redemption (Exod 6:6-7):** The four "I will" statements (bring out, rid, redeem, take) allegorically map the stages of spiritual transformation:
1.  ***Bring out:*** Initial separation from the ego's control.
2.  ***Rid:*** Cleansing the self of the effects and habits of bondage.
3.  ***Redeem:*** The process of acquiring the soul back from corruption.
4.  ***Take:*** The final act of entering into a conscious spiritual relationship (covenant) with the Divine.

**I.3. The Genealogy (Exod 6:14-25):** The detailed, seemingly disruptive list of names is not historical but a **spiritual line of descent**. It establishes that the **Principle of Divine Law (Moses)** and the **Principle of Expression (Aaron)** arise from the Tribe of **Inner Will (Levi)**, thereby validating their authority as *internal* faculties of the will, derived from the foundational **Aspects of Inner Sight (Reuben)** and **Hearing/Obedience (Simeon)**.

**I.4. "Uncircumcised Expression" (Exod 6:12):** The Law (Moses) claims to be of **"uncircumcised lips,"** meaning the Law is inherently profound and spiritual but lacks the purified, ready capacity for **verbal articulation** or external action without the aid of **Expression (Aaron)**.
