# 🕊️ The Bible Key Version (BKV) — Core Principles
### *Foundations for the Architecture of Spiritual Interpretation*

---

## **1. The Bible as Personal Biography**
The Bible is the inner autobiography of the soul.  
Every story, place, and event represents the evolving states of consciousness on its journey from ignorance to divine realization.

- **People** = Faculties or attitudes of mind  
- **Places** = States of consciousness  
- **Numbers** = Laws or stages of order  
- **Objects** = Instruments of spiritual function  

> _The Bible is a mirror: whoever reads it finds himself upon its pages._

---

## **2. Symbolism and Allegory**
Each passage contains three interpretive layers:

| Layer | Function | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Literal** | Outer narrative | Historical surface |
| **Psychological** | Inner faculty | David = Spiritual courage |
| **Spiritual** | Divine law | Goliath = Apparent obstacle of fear |

---

## **3. The Divine Process**
All revelation follows a single repeating pattern:

1. **Conception** — Idea or Word is planted.  
2. **Conflict** — Resistance and testing arise.  
3. **Crisis / Judgment** — False forms collapse.  
4. **Renewal** — Higher faculty is born.  
5. **Rest** — Union with Divine Order established.

---

## **4. Covenant and Transformation**
Every name change signifies transmutation:  
- *Abram → Abraham* — expansion of faith  
- *Jacob → Israel* — awakening of divine identity  
- *Saul → Paul* — conversion of intellect to humility  

The Covenant is not legal—it is the **bond of awareness** between human and Divine.

## **5. Narrative Forms in the BKV**

## **6. Interpretive Conventions**
- Names are shown as *Literal (Symbolic Meaning)*.  
- Divine titles vary by context: *The Source*, *The All-Sufficient*, etc.  
- Key laws appear in italics (e.g., *Law of Measure*).  
- Tables formatted for mobile readability.

- Reappearance under new symbols  

> _Revelation is progressive; truth unfolds as consciousness grows._

---

## **VI. Application Rules for Writing**

1. **Name the governing law early.**  
2. **Translate and interpret all major names.**  
3. **Use “but / therefore” transitions** to mark transformation.  
4. **Follow the 5-stage arc**: Conception → Conflict → Crisis → Renewal → Rest.  
5. **End with a personal reflection** linking law to the soul’s experience.

---

## **VII. Example: Name Analysis**

**Moses (משה)**  
- Letters: Mem (flow) + Shin (fire) + He (breath)  
- Meaning: *The flow of life purified by fire and inspired by breath*  
- Faculty: Spiritual will drawing truth from subconscious waters  
- Parallel: Noah (deliverance from waters) → Christ (deliverance through Spirit)
