## Matthew 3 (BKV Symbolic-Only Restatement)

1. In those days **Yahweh is Gracious (John)** came, proclaiming in _the_ **Wilderness**,  

2. saying, “Repent, for _the_ **Reign of Heaven** has drawn near.”  

3. For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet, saying:  
“The voice of one crying in _the_ **Wilderness**:  
Prepare _the_ way of the Lord; make his paths straight.”  

4. **Yahweh is Gracious** himself wore clothing of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.  

5. Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all _the_ region around _the_ **Descent (Jordan)**,  

6. and they were **Immersed (Baptized)** by him in _the_ **Descent**, confessing their sins.  

7. But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his **Immersion**, he said, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from _the_ coming wrath?”  

8. “Bear fruit in keeping with repentance.”  

9. “And do not think to say within yourselves, ‘We have **Faith (Abraham)** as our father,’ for I tell you that God is able from these stones to raise up children to **Faith**.”  

10. “Even now _the_ axe is laid to _the_ root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into _the_ fire.”  

11. “I indeed **Immerse** you in water for repentance; but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will **Immerse** you in the Holy Spirit and fire.”  

12. “His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into _the_ barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.”  

13. Then **Yahweh Saves** came from Galilee to _the_ **Descent** to **Yahweh is Gracious**, to be **Immersed** by him.  

14. But **Yahweh is Gracious** tried to prevent him, saying, “I need to be **Immersed** by you, and do you come to me?”  

15. But **Yahweh Saves** answered him, “Allow it now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he allowed him.  

16. When **Yahweh Saves** was **Immersed**, immediately he went up from _the_ water; and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon him.  

17. And behold, a voice from the heavens said, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”
