# 1 Samuel 16 — The Principle of Inner Renewal
### *The Anointing of David and the Passing of the Spirit*

> _“Man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.”_  
> — **1 Samuel 16 : 7 KJV**

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

### **I. The Prophet Sent Again (vv 1–5)**  

The Source said to **Samuel (Prophetic Conscience)**,  
> “How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?  
> Fill thine horn with oil, and go; I will send thee to **Jesse the Bethlehemite**, for I have provided Me a king among his sons.”  

Samuel feared Saul’s wrath but obeyed, taking a heifer for sacrifice and coming to **Bethlehem (House of Bread)**.  

*Conscience must cease mourning failure and turn again to purpose.  The past is not to be pitied but transcended.*

### **II. The Rejected Appearances (vv 6–10)**  

When they came, Samuel looked on **Eliab (God Is My Father)** and said,  
> “Surely the Source’s anointed is before Him.”  

But the Source said,  
> “Look not on his countenance, nor on the height of his stature; for I have refused him.  
> For man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Source looketh on the heart.”  

Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel, and the Source chose none of them.  

*The seven rejected sons represent the perfection of appearances — all that is admirable but not awakened.*

### **III. The Anointing of the Hidden One (vv 11–13)**  

Samuel said unto Jesse,  
> “Are here all thy children?”  

He answered,  
> “There remaineth yet the youngest, and behold, he keepeth the sheep.”  

They sent and brought him in. He was ruddy, with a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to.  
The Source said,  
> “Arise, anoint him: for this is he.”  

Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren,  
and the **Spirit of the Source came upon David from that day forward.**  

*The inner shepherd — humility in service — becomes the vessel of divine dominion.*

---

### **IV. The Departing Spirit and the Troubled King (vv 14–23)**  

The Spirit of the Source departed from Saul, and an **evil spirit of distress** troubled him.  
His servants said,  
> “Let our lord command thy servants to seek a man who is a cunning player on a harp.”  

One said,  
> “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse that is cunning in playing, prudent in matters, valiant, and the Source is with him.”  

David came to Saul and stood before him; and Saul loved him greatly, and he became his armor-bearer.  
Whenever the evil spirit was upon Saul, David took a harp and played; so Saul was refreshed, and the evil spirit departed from him.  

*The Inner King begins his quiet reign within the troubled realm — harmony soothing the discord of lost obedience.*

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Samuel 16** reveals the **Law of Inner Renewal** — the Spirit’s transfer from the outer form to the inner life.

- **Saul** represents the decaying outer will — strength without submission.  
- **Samuel** is Conscience renewed through obedience.  
- **Jesse** symbolizes the root of the natural self — the human lineage of experience.  
- **David (Beloved)** is the awakened heart — pure devotion that harmonizes all faculties.  
- **Bethlehem (House of Bread)** represents the consciousness of spiritual nourishment — the birthplace of love.  
- **The Harp** is the symbol of attunement — divine vibration that restores order to the disquieted soul.  

Thus begins the new dominion: not of sword and decree, but of song and Spirit.  
The kingdom is inward before it is outward; music precedes might.

## **Addendum — The Law of Inner Renewal**

The Spirit departs from the will that resists and descends upon the heart that yields.  
True leadership is never appointed by appearance but by resonance with divine harmony.  
The harp in the hand of the shepherd heals what the scepter could not command.  
The soul’s renewal begins when love becomes its king.

## **Core BKV Principle — 1 Samuel 16**

> **When outer strength fails, the Spirit seeks the heart.  
> The true king arises not by stature but by song — harmony is the sign of divine renewal.**
