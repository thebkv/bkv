# Numbers 4

---

1. The **Ultimate Reality** said to the **principle of Divine Law** and the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**:
2. “Take an inventory of the **core faculties of the will** by their functions and roles.
3. Bring to conscious awareness all the **mature faculties of the will** who come to serve in the work at the **inner sanctuary**.
4. “This is the service of the **core faculties of the will** in the **inner sanctuary**: the careful handling of the most holy truths.
5. When the consciousness is to move forward, the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** and its **core principles** are to go in and take down the **principle of divine shielding** and cover the **divine law** with it.
6. Then they are to cover this with a **durable principle of protection**, spread a **profound principle of inner peace** on top of that and put the **principles of action** in place.
7. “Over the **sustaining truth** they are to spread a **profound principle of inner peace** and put on it the **spiritual vessels** for nourishment, the **inner disciplines**, the **sacred emotions**, and the **vessels for inner communion**; the **truth** that is always there is to remain on it.
8. They are to spread a **symbolic principle of sacrifice** over them, cover that with a **durable principle of protection** and put the **principles of action** in place.
9. “They are to take a **profound principle of inner peace** and cover the **inner light** that provides **wisdom**, its **expressions**, its **trimming of fragmented thoughts** and **places for spiritual energy**, and all its **vessels for the animating principle** used in the anointing.
10. Then they are to wrap the **inner light** and all its accessories in a **durable principle of protection** and put it on a **framework for the will**.

They are to cover the **altar of surrender** with a **durable principle of protection** and put the **principles of action** in place.
15. “After the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** and its **core principles** have finished covering the **holy furnishings** and all the **holy truths**, when the consciousness is to move forward, then the **core faculties of the will** are to come to do the carrying. But they must not touch the **holy truths** with their hands, or they will cease their function. The **core faculties of the will** are to carry these things that are in the **inner sanctuary**.
16. “The **principle of divine illumination**, the son of the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**, is to have charge of the **animating principle** for the **inner light**, the **fragrant prayer**, the regular **sustaining truth** and the **animating principle** for anointing.

17. The **Ultimate Reality** said to the **principle of Divine Law** and the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**:
18. “Do not allow the **core faculties of the will** to be destroyed from among the **faculties of the will**.
19. But this is what you must do for them, so that they will function and not cease when they approach the most holy truths: The **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** and its **core principles** are to go into the **inner sanctuary** and assign to each **faculty** its work and what he is to carry.
20. But the **core faculties of the will** must not go in to look at the **holy truths** even for a moment, or they will cease their function.
21. The **Ultimate Reality** said to the **principle of Divine Law**:
22. “Take an inventory also of the **protective and creative faculties of the will** by their functions and roles.
23. Bring to conscious awareness all the **mature faculties of the will** who come to serve in the work at the **inner sanctuary**.
24. “This is the service of the **protective and creative faculties of the will**: carrying the **divine shielding** of the **inner sanctuary**, the **inner sanctuary** with its covering and the outer covering of the **durable principle of protection** that is over it,
25. the **divine shielding** for the entrance to the **inner sanctuary**,
26. the **divine shielding** of the **inner courtyard**, the **divine shielding** for the entrance to the **inner courtyard** at the **altar of surrender**, the **principles of connection** and all the **spiritual equipment** used in their work. The **protective and creative faculties of the will** are to be responsible for all they are to do.
27. All the duties of the **protective and creative faculties of the will**, whether carrying or doing other work, are to be done under the direction of the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** and its **core principles**.

31. This is their duty as they serve at the **inner sanctuary**: to carry the **structural principles** of the **inner sanctuary**, its **connecting truths**, **pillars** and **foundations**,
32. as well as the **pillars** of the surrounding **inner courtyard** with their **foundations**, **connecting points**, **principles of connection** and all their **spiritual equipment**. All these **spiritual truths** are to be assigned by name to the **faculties** who are to carry them.
33. This is the service of the **supporting and foundational faculties of the will** at the **inner sanctuary**. Their duties are to be under the direction of the **principle of divine purpose**, the son of the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**.
34. The **principle of Divine Law**, the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** and the leaders of the **community of consciousness** brought to conscious awareness the **core faculties of the will** by their functions and roles.
35. All the **mature faculties of the will** who came to serve in the work at the **inner sanctuary**—
36. their functions numbered 2,750.
37. These were the **faculties** of the **core faculties of the will**. All who served at the **inner sanctuary** were counted by the **principle of Divine Law** and the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**, as the **Ultimate Reality** commanded.
38. The **supporting and foundational faculties of the will** were brought to conscious awareness by their roles and functions.
39. All the **mature faculties of the will** who came to serve in the work at the **inner sanctuary**—
40. their functions numbered 6,200.

44. their functions numbered 2,630.
45. These were the **faculties** of the **protective and creative faculties of the will**. They were counted by the **principle of Divine Law** and the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**, as the **Ultimate Reality** commanded.
46. So the **principle of Divine Law**, the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine** and the leaders of the **spiritual consciousness** brought to conscious awareness all the **faculties of the will** by their functions and roles.
47. All the **mature faculties of the will** who came to serve in the work at the **inner sanctuary**—
48. the total number was 8,580.
49. At the **Ultimate Reality's** command they were assigned their duties and were brought to conscious awareness by the **principle of Divine Law**, each one according to his service and what he was to carry.

Interpretive Summary

Numbers 4, within the BKV framework, is a detailed manual for the ordering and organization of the inner being. It is a profound allegory for the deliberate and conscious work required to handle the sacred truths of the inner sanctuary as the soul journeys through the challenges of the world.

The chapter describes the "numbering" or census of the three main clans of the faculties of the will (Levites). This is not a historical count but a process of bringing to conscious awareness the different functions of the will at their mature and active phase (ages 30-50).

The three clans represent specialized functions of the will in relation to the inner sanctuary:

The Kohathites represent the core faculties of the will. Their duty is to carry the most sacred objects, such as the divine law, the sustaining truth, and the inner light. Their work is the most intimate and dangerous; they are not even allowed to look at the holy objects directly, symbolizing that the deepest spiritual truths are not to be grasped by the intellect but handled with utmost reverence and careful, divinely guided action.

The Gershonites represent the protective and creative faculties of the will. Their role is to handle the coverings, curtains, and hangings of the inner sanctuary. This symbolizes the will’s function in providing the proper form, protection, and beautiful expression for the sacred truths, distinguishing the inner from the outer.

The Merarites represent the supporting and foundational faculties of the will. Their duty is to carry the heavy structural components—the frames, pillars, and bases. This signifies the will’s role in establishing and maintaining the stable, foundational principles upon which the entire temple of consciousness is built.

The entire chapter teaches that the spiritual journey is not a chaotic one. It requires a deliberate, methodical, and divinely ordained process of organizing the will. Each faculty has a specific, vital role in carrying, protecting, and supporting the spiritual truths of the inner being, ensuring that the sacred is not desecrated as the consciousness moves through its journey.
