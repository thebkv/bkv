# John 3 — BKV Study (Spiritual Regeneration and the Forerunner)

John 3 has one of the most critical scenes in BKV study: the necessity of **Spiritual Regeneration** (Being Born Again), followed by the definitive statement on the role of the **Initiatory Principle**.

## BKV-NR Part 1: The New Birth (vv. 1–21)

1. There was a **Principle of Moral Orthodoxy (Nicodemus)**, a **Ruler** of the **Spiritual Identity (Jews)**:
2. The same came to the **Christ Principle** by **Night (State of Unilluminated Mind)**, and said, “Rabbi, we know that you are a **Principle of Teaching** from the **Divine Source**.”
3. The **Christ Principle** answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, Except an **Aspect of the Soul** be **Born Again (Spiritual Regeneration)**, he cannot see the **Inner State of Divine Rule**.”
4. **Principle of Moral Orthodoxy** said to Him, “How can an **Aspect of the Soul** be **Born** when it is **Old**? Can he enter a second time into the **Womb of the Natural Mind**?”
5. The **Christ Principle** answered, “Except an **Aspect of the Soul** be born of **Purification (Water)** and of **Divine Energy (Spirit)**, he cannot enter into the **Inner State of Divine Rule**.”
6. That which is born of the **Natural Mind (Flesh)** is **Natural**; and that which is born of the **Divine Energy** is **Spiritual**.
8. The **Uncontrollable Divine Will (Wind)** blows where it lists, and you hear the **Inner Sound** thereof, but cannot tell whence it comes, and whither it goes: so is every one that is born of the **Divine Energy**.
12. If I have told you **Principles of the Natural Mind (Earthly things)**, and you believe not, how shall you believe, if I tell you **Principles of the Spiritual Mind (Heavenly things)**?
14. And as **Moses** lifted up the **Principle of the Lower Self (Serpent)** in the **Outer Wilderness**, even so must the **Christ Principle** be lifted up:
15. That whosoever believes in **Him** should not perish, but have **Eternal Inner Life**.

## BKV-NR Part 2: The Forerunner’s Joy (vv. 22–36)

22. After these things came the **Christ Principle** and **His Principles** into the **Inner State of Rigid Practice (Judea)**; and there **He** tarried, and practiced the **Initiatory Principle of Purification (Baptizing)**.
27. **The Initiatory Principle (John)** answered, “An **Aspect of the Soul** can receive nothing, except it be given him from **Spiritual Heaven**.”
29. He that has the **Soul (Bride)** is the **Christ Principle (Bridegroom)**: but the **Initiatory Principle (Friend of the Bridegroom)**, who stands and hears **Him**, **rejoices greatly** because of the **Christ Principle**’s voice: this **Inner Joy** therefore is mine, it is fulfilled.
30. **He** must **Increase**, but I must **Decrease**.
31. **He** that comes from **Spiritual Heaven** is above all: he that is of the **Natural Mind** is **Natural**, and speaks of the **Natural Mind**: **He** that comes from **Spiritual Heaven** is above all.
34. For **He** whom **Divine Source** has sent speaks the **Living Utterances** of the **Divine Source**: for **Divine Source** gives not the **Divine Energy** by **measure** unto **Him**.

## Commentary on the Action

John 3 details the transition from the highest form of **Moral Orthodoxy (Nicodemus)** to **Spiritual Regeneration**. The **Christ Principle** declares that the highest efforts of the natural mind are insufficient; a birth from **Purification** and **Divine Energy** is required. This means aligning the will (water) with the **Uncontrollable Divine Will** (Spirit). The second half, driven by the **Initiatory Principle (John the Baptist)**, defines the necessary spiritual hierarchy: the work of preparation (John) must yield completely (**Decrease**) to the **Christ Principle**'s fulfillment (**Increase**) so that the soul can unite with its true **Bridegroom**.

## Interpretive Insights

**I.1. The Necessity of New Birth (John 3:3-8):** The BKV emphasizes that **Spiritual Regeneration (Born Again)** is a **qualitative change** ("from above"—*anōthen*), not a temporal one. The two elements are essential:
* **Water (Purification):** The conscious decision, the aligning of the lower will, and the process of **moral cleansing** (the human side).
* **Spirit (Divine Energy):** The **Uncontrollable Divine Will** (the Divine side) that animates the new life.
The **Principle of Moral Orthodoxy (Nicodemus)** fails because he tries to understand a **Spiritual** process using **Natural Mind** logic ("how can I enter the womb again?").

**I.2. The Serpent and Eternal Inner Life (John 3:14-15):** The lifting up of the serpent is the **Principle of the Lower Self (flesh/sin)** being **crucified and surrendered** on the **Principle of Sacrifice (Cross)**. The soul must fully acknowledge and condemn its lower nature. This act of complete submission is what grants **Eternal Inner Life**—the continuous flow of consciousness with the Divine Source.

**I.3. The Law of Increase and Decrease (John 3:30):** This is the definitive statement on the relationship between the **Preparatory Principle** and the **Divine Principle**.
* **John the Baptist (Initiatory Principle) must Decrease:** The work of purification, moral striving, and external preparation must be surrendered and diminished. Its purpose is only to prepare the way.
* **Christ Principle must Increase:** The Divine Life itself must expand and take over the entire consciousness. The **Initiatory Principle** finds its greatest fulfillment and **Inner Joy** not in its own success, but in the **marriage** (union) of the **Christ Principle** and the **Soul (Bride)**.
