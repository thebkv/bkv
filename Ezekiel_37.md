### Ezekiel 37 — BKV (Tuned)

1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and He brought me out in the **Spirit** and set me down in the middle of a **Valley**, and it was full of **bones**.
2 And He led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the **valley**, and behold, they were very **dry**.
3 And He said to me, “Son of **Man** (a human consciousness), can these **bones** live?” And I answered, “O Lord GOD, you know.”
4 Then He said to me, “**Prophesy** (speak truth) to these **bones**, and say to them, O you **dry bones**, hear the word of the LORD.
5 Thus says the Lord GOD to these **bones**: Behold, I will cause **breath** (spirit) to enter you, and you shall live.
6 And I will lay **sinews** (cohesion) upon you, and will cause **flesh** (form) to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put **breath** in you, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the LORD.”

7 So I **prophesied** as I was commanded. And as I **prophesied**, there was a sound, and behold, a rattling, and the **bones** came together, bone to its bone.
8 And I looked, and behold, there were **sinews** on them, and **flesh** had come upon them, and skin had covered them from above. But there was no **breath** in them.
9 Then He said to me, “**Prophesy** to the **breath**; **prophesy**, Son of **Man**, and say to the **breath**, Thus says the Lord GOD: Come from the four **winds**, O **breath**, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.”
10 So I **prophesied** as He commanded me, and the **breath** came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army.

11 Then He said to me, “Son of **Man**, these **bones** are the whole house of **Spiritual Consciousness** (Israel). Behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dry, our hope is lost; we are indeed cut off.’
12 Therefore **prophesy**, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people. And I will bring you into the land of **Inner Union** (Israel).
13 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people.
14 And I will put my **Spirit** in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it, declares the LORD.”
