Ezekiel 37 — BKV (Tuned, Refined)  

1 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and He brought me out in the Spirit and set me down in the middle of a Valley (a low state of consciousness), and it was full of bones.  
2 And He led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley, and behold, they were very dry (devoid of vitality).  
3 And He said to me, “Son of Man (a human consciousness), can these bones live?” And I answered, “O Lord GOD, you know.”  
4 Then He said to me, “Prophesy (speak truth) to these bones, and say to them, O you dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.  
5 Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath (spirit) to enter you, and you shall live.  
6 And I will lay sinews (cohesion) upon you, and will cause flesh (form) to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the LORD.”  

7 So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a sound, and behold, a rattling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.  
8 And I looked, and behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh had come upon them, and skin had covered them from above. But there was no breath in them.  
9 Then He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, Son of Man, and say to the breath, Thus says the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.”  
10 So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army (a fully awakened power).  

11 Then He said to me, “Son of Man, these bones are the whole house of Spiritual Consciousness (Israel). Behold, they say, ‘Our bones are dry, our hope is lost; we are indeed cut off.’  
12 Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I will open your graves (states of burial in despair), and raise you from your graves, O my people. And I will bring you into the land of Inner Union (Israel).  
13 And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I open your graves, and raise you from your graves, O my people.  
14 And I will put my Spirit (true life, divine breath) in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it, declares the LORD.”
