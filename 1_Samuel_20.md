# 1 Samuel 20 — The Principle of Sacred Covenant

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

### **I. The Question of Safety (vv 1–8)**  

David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came to **Jonathan (Faith)**, saying,  
> “What have I done? What is mine iniquity, that thy father seeks my life?”  

Jonathan replied,  
> “Thou shalt not die: my father does nothing without showing it to me.”  

But David answered,  
> “Truly thy father knows you love me, and therefore hides it.”  

They made a covenant:  
> “If there is guilt in me, slay me yourself; but if innocence, protect me.”  

*Love seeks truth from faith — the heart imploring the believing faculty to judge honestly.*

---

### **II. The Test of Intent (vv 9–17)**  

Jonathan said,  
> “Tomorrow is the new moon. Thou shalt be missed, for thy seat will be empty.”  

He devised a sign:  
If Saul’s anger flared, David would know his doom was certain.  
They swore together before the Source:  
> “The Source be witness between me and thee, and between thy seed and my seed forever.”  

Jonathan made David swear again in love, for he loved him as his own soul.  

*Faith and love join in eternal loyalty — a bond beyond circumstance.*

---

### **III. The Feast and the Fury (vv 18–34)**  

At the feast of the new moon, Saul sat at the table.  
On the first day, he noticed David’s absence but said nothing.  
On the second day, he asked Jonathan,  
> “Why comes not the son of Jesse to meat?”  

Jonathan answered according to their plan.  
Then Saul’s anger was kindled; he cast a javelin at his own son.  

*The outer will, unable to strike love, turns upon faith itself.  Jealousy always wounds its own belief first.*

---

### **IV. The Signal of Departure (vv 35–40)**  

Jonathan went out into the field with a lad to shoot arrows as appointed.  
He cried,  
> “The arrow is beyond thee,”  
signaling that David must flee.  
The lad knew nothing of the meaning; only the two understood.

*Divine friendship operates in symbols — truth known only to the awakened faculties within.*

---

### **V. The Farewell and Covenant Renewed (vv 41–42)**  

David arose from his hiding place, bowed three times, and they kissed each other and wept together,  
but David wept the more.  

Jonathan said,  
> “Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the Source, saying,  
> ‘The Source be between me and thee, and between thy seed and my seed forever.’”  

Then David departed, and Jonathan returned to the city.

*Love goes into exile, but faith remains as its unseen guardian; their covenant endures within.*

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Samuel 20** reveals the **Law of Sacred Covenant** — the spiritual bond that unites faith and love even when outer harmony is lost.

- **Jonathan** represents faith’s steadfast loyalty.  
- **David** represents divine love under persecution.  
- **Saul** is the outer will at war with both.  
- **The New Moon** symbolizes renewal — the hidden light returning after darkness.  
- **The Arrows** signify intuitive communication beyond literal understanding.  
- **The Field** is the open awareness where truth is tested and made plain.  

This chapter marks the passage from companionship to separation — yet the covenant between believing and loving remains the soul’s unbreakable bridge across division.

## **Addendum — The Law of Sacred Covenant**

When the heart (love) must flee the outer turmoil,  
faith remains as the invisible guardian of truth.  
Their bond cannot be broken by distance or misunderstanding;  
it is the secret bridge through every exile of the soul.

---

## **Core BKV Principle — 1 Samuel 20**

> **When faith and love covenant together, the will cannot divide them.  
> Their bond remains the hidden axis of peace within the soul.**

# **BKV-DR — 1 Samuel 20**
### *Faith and Love Preserve Loyalty Amid Division*

---

20 : 1–8  
Love came to faith in distress,  
saying, “Why does the will seek my life?”  
Faith answered gently,  
“No harm shall come to you; I will stand beside you.”  
But love knew the fear ran deeper than reason,  
and pleaded,  
“If there be fault in me, let truth strike me,  
but if innocence, then guard me.”  
So faith and love swore together before the Source,  
that honesty should rule between them forever.

---

20 : 9–17  
Faith said, “Tomorrow the new moon rises—  
your place will be empty, but not forgotten.”  
They planned a secret sign,  
a message carried by an arrow beyond the reach of words.  
And they vowed again,  
that even if the world fell apart,  
their bond would remain in the Presence of the Source.  
Faith loved love as its own soul,  
and love trusted faith beyond fear.

---

20 : 18–34  
The feast of appearance came;  
the seat of love was empty,  
and the will grew dark with suspicion.  
It hurled the spear not at love, but at faith itself,  
for jealousy always wounds belief first.  
Faith rose from the table in sorrow,  
knowing that innocence can no longer dwell  
where pride has taken the throne.

---

20 : 35–40  
In the field of quiet understanding,  
faith loosed its arrow and cried, “It is beyond thee!”  
The outer ear heard only instruction,  
but the heart within knew the sign:  
love must go, for danger had awakened.  
Thus truth spoke in symbol,  
and love heard without sound.

---

20 : 41–42  
Then love rose from hiding,  
and the two embraced,  
weeping the tears of separation and gratitude together.  
Faith said,  
“The Source be between us—between what believes and what loves—  
for ever.”  
And love departed into the wilderness,  
while faith returned to its duties,  
keeping the covenant unseen.

---

### **Meditative Reflection**

> Within me, faith and love are one heart.  
> Though life divides their paths,  
> their promise endures in silence.  
> Faith waits, love journeys,  
> and the Source abides between them.
