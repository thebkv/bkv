# **1 Samuel 21 — The Principle of Sacred Bread**
### *Divine Provision in the Exile of Love*

> _“So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD.”_  
> — **1 Samuel 21 : 6 KJV**

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

### **I. Love in Exile (vv 1–6)**  

David came to **Nob (Sanctuary of Speech)**, unto **Ahimelech (Brother of the King)** the priest.  
The priest trembled, saying,  
> “Why art thou alone?”  

David replied,  
> “The king hath commanded me a secret matter.”  

He asked for bread; Ahimelech answered,  
> “There is no common bread, but the hallowed bread—if the young men have kept themselves pure.”  

David said, “Truly they are pure.”  
So the priest gave him the **hallowed bread (Shewbread)** that had been taken from before the Source.  

*Love, even in exile, finds sustenance from the holy center; purity of motive opens access to divine provision.*

---

### **II. The Sword of Memory (vv 7–9)**  

David said,  
> “Is there here any weapon?”  

Ahimelech replied,  
> “The sword of Goliath, whom thou slew, is wrapped behind the ephod.”  

David said,  
> “There is none like that; give it me.”  

*The victory of faith becomes the tool of preservation; past revelation arms present need.*

---

### **III. The Flight to Gath (vv 10–15)**  

David arose and fled to **Achish (King of Gath)**.  
The servants said,  
> “Is not this David, the king of the land? Did they not sing of him, ‘Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?’”  

David feared and **disguised himself**, scratching upon the doors and letting his spittle fall upon his beard.  
Achish said,  
> “Have I need of madmen?” and drove him away.  

*Love hides its identity in the land of fear; divine wisdom veils itself until safety is restored.*

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Samuel 21** portrays the **Law of Sacred Bread and Hidden Strength**.  
When the heart leaves familiar sanctuaries, the Source still provides both nourishment and remembrance:

- **Ahimelech** represents the intuitive priesthood within—the channel of divine provision to the wandering consciousness.  
- **The Shewbread** signifies spiritual sustenance: truth still warm from the altar.  
- **Goliath’s sword** symbolizes past illumination turned into present defense.  
- **Disguise in Gath** illustrates humility—the willingness of divine love to appear foolish in the world of pride rather than be destroyed by it.  

The inner law: *Purity draws provision; humility secures protection.*

## **Addendum — The Law of Sacred Bread**

When divine love is driven from its place of rest, the Source feeds it from the inner altar.  
Yesterday’s truth becomes today’s sustenance; yesterday’s victory becomes today’s weapon.  
Humility is its cloak, but purity is its strength.

## **Core BKV Principle — 1 Samuel 21**

> **When love is exiled, the Source feeds it with truth from within;   
> the soul never wanders beyond the reach of holy bread.**

# **BKV-DR — 1 Samuel 21**
### *Divine Provision in the Exile of Love*

---

21 : 1–6  
I wandered from the house of peace,  
alone and trembling before the silence.  
In the sanctuary of speech, a gentle priest within me asked,  
“Why come you alone?”  
And I answered, “The King has sent me on a secret matter.”  
He offered only the bread of holiness.  
I said, “My heart is pure.”  
So he gave me that which once stood before the Presence—  
warm truth from the inner altar—  
and my soul was fed.  

Even in exile, the Source remembers hunger  
and gives nourishment unseen by the world.

---

21 : 7–9  
I asked, “Is there a weapon here?”  
And the voice replied,  
“The sword of the fear you once defeated lies behind the ephod.”  
I took it and said within,  
“There is none like it.”  
Past victory became present courage;  
memory turned to strength.

---

21 : 10–15  
I went down into the land of fear,  
among those who did not know the Source.  
They said, “Is this not the beloved one?”  
and suspicion rose.  
So I hid my light,  
let the world call me mad,  
and passed through their gates unnoticed.  

Sometimes wisdom wears humility as disguise,  
until safety opens again its door.

---

### **Meditative Reflection**

> The altar feeds me though I walk afar.  
> Truth still warm from the Presence becomes my bread.  
> The sword of yesterday’s faith guards today’s heart.  
> Humility keeps me hidden,  
> but the Source keeps me alive.
