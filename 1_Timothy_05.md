*1 Timothy 5 — BKV Study (Stewardship and Compassionate Order)**
### *Regulating the Inner Community: Honor, Widowhood, and the Elder Faculties*

> *“Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren; the elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.” — 1 Timothy 5:1–2 KJV*
> *“The mature consciousness administers its internal relationships not with harsh judgment, but with balanced reverence and practical care.”*

## **BKV-NR Context**

Following the qualifications for **Governance (Ch. 3)** and the call to **Vigilance (Ch. 4)**, Chapter 5 unfolds the compassionate practice of that order. If Chapters 1–4 establish *structure*, this chapter teaches *how* that structure must act — not by control, but by **reverence and wise stewardship**. The focus is on the responsible care of the soul's various internal resources and impulses.

---

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**

1.  **Rebuke not an Elder (Principle of Mature Wisdom)** harshly, but **intreat him as a father**; and the **younger men (newer active faculties)** as brethren;
2.  The **Elder women (mature receptive faculties)** as mothers; the **younger (newer receptive impulses)** as sisters, with all **purity (lack of self-interest)**.
3.  **Honour widows** that are **widows indeed** (recognize and support true, dedicated principles that have severed their bond with the ego/flesh).
4.  But if any **widow** has **children or nephews** (subordinate thoughts or memories rooted in the past state), let them first show **piety at home** (discipline in their immediate domain) and **requite their parents** (honor their origins): for that is good and acceptable before the Source.
5.  Now she that is a **widow indeed** (a truly focused, unattached principle), and **desolate** (unsupported by external sense-data), **trusts in the Source**, and continues in **supplications and prayers night and day** (continuous communion).
6.  But she that **lives in pleasure** (indulgence of sense-data) is **dead while she lives** (a spiritual faculty that is dormant).

---

**(v. 7–16 — On the Dedicated Widows)**

9.  Let a **widow** (a principle of pure receptive devotion) be taken into the **number** (recognized for service) only if she is **threescore years old** (mature and proven), having been the **wife of one man** (committed to singular truth).
10. Well reported of for **good works** (verifiable outer conduct); if she has **brought up children** (nurtured spiritual results), if she has **lodged strangers** (received new illumination), if she has **washed the saints’ feet** (humbly served subordinate pure thoughts), and has **diligently followed every good work**.
11. But the **younger widows** (new, easily distracted receptive impulses) refuse: for when they have begun to **wax wanton against Christ** (distracted by desire away from the Core Truth), they will **marry** (re-attach to external sense-data).
13. And withal they learn to be **idle**, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but **tattlers** (disorderly thoughts) and **busybodies** (interfering impulses), speaking things which they ought not.

---

**(v. 17–25 — On Elders and Judgment)**

17. Let the **elders that rule well** (mature faculties of wisdom that govern effectively) be counted worthy of **double honour**, especially they who **labour in the word and doctrine** (those that apply effort to defining and communicating Inner Truth).
19. Against an **elder** receive not an accusation, but before **two or three witnesses** (judgment must be corroborated by multiple, stable faculties).
20. Them that sin **rebuke before all** (address error openly within consciousness), that others (subordinate faculties) may **fear** (learn self-correction).
21. I charge thee… that thou **observe these things without preferring one before another** (administer the inner law without bias).
22. **Lay hands suddenly on no man** (do not rush to assign authority to an untested faculty), nor be **partaker of other men’s sins** (do not absorb another’s error).
23. **Drink no longer water** (do not subsist on simple truth alone), but use a little **wine** (illumined joy) for thy **stomach’s sake** (spiritual center) and thine often **infirmities** (areas of weakness).

## **Commentary on the Action**

**1 Timothy 5** is the chapter of **Inner Stewardship and Compassionate Administration**.
It completes the sequence of order by tempering **authority with mercy**, showing that spiritual government matures through **care**, not control.

### **The Law of Inner Relationship (v. 1–2)**
The governing consciousness must rule its faculties through **reverence**, not reprimand. **Elder Faculties** (wisdom) are treated as fathers and mothers; **Younger Faculties** (new impulses) as brothers and sisters. Judgment is replaced by **intreatment** (persuasion, patience, and fraternal love), ensuring the inner world is administered with **purity** (lack of self-interest).

### **The Widow — Principle of Pure Devotion (v. 3–16)**
The **Widow** symbolizes the **Receptive Faculty detached from the world-ego** (the "husband"). She sustains the Church of the Soul through *unceasing communion* rather than rule.
* **Widow Indeed:** The mature principle that relies **only on the Source** and maintains continual prayer. This faculty is worthy of the highest inner support.
* **Younger Widows:** Unstable receptive impulses that detach then **re-attach to desire** ("marry" external sense-data). They are refused permanent service until they demonstrate **proven maturity** (age 60, good works, singular devotion).

This shows that the **Inner Church** relies on a trinity of powers: **Order (Bishop), Action (Deacon), and Devotion (Widow)**.

### **Elders and Caution (v. 17–25)**
The rules regarding **Elders (Mature Wisdom)** and judgment reinforce the need for **Corroborated Authority**: accusations against high-level faculties must be verified by **"two or three witnesses"** (multiple, stable aspects of consciousness) to prevent rash judgment. The warning **"Lay hands suddenly on no man"** warns against the error of **premature delegation** of inner authority. Finally, the use of **wine** and **water** illustrates the balance between **basic truth** (water) and **inspired joy** (wine) needed to sustain the **Spiritual Center** ("stomach").

## **Interpretive Insights**

**I.1. Purity in Administration (v. 21):**
**Impartiality is a divine law.** The governing consciousness must apply its principles equally across all internal faculties, without **preferring one before another**—free from favoritism toward comfortable thoughts or prejudice against challenging ones.

**I.2. The Use of Wine (v. 23):**
The "wine" symbolizes **illumined consciousness**—moments of spiritual exaltation that revitalize the inner life. This elevation is a *remedy* for **spiritual weariness** ("infirmities") when discipline alone proves insufficient.

**I.3. Visibility of Character (v. 24–25):**
The quality of each faculty will eventually **reveal itself through its works**. The spiritual governor must exercise **patience in discernment**; the true state of a principle, whether good or bad, will ultimately be made plain.
