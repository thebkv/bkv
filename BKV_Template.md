## SUMMARY

A clear, readable narrative orientation to the chapter.  
Explain the crisis, movement, or central tension.  
Introduce key symbolic elements.  
Set the emotional and spiritual stage for the deeper architecture.  
Keep this section warm, accessible, and devotional.

---

# I. NATURAL READING (NR)

A straightforward retelling of the chapter’s events.  
Avoid symbolism here — this is the “story level.”  
Think of it as the literal scaffolding the symbolic reading grows upon.

---

# II. DEEP READING (DR)

Here is where the symbolic anatomy of the chapter unfolds:  
- Names → faculties  
- Places → states of consciousness  
- Actions → inner movements  
- Conflict → misalignment  
- Resolution → restoration  

Use this section to reveal the chapter’s **inner architecture**.

---

# III. COMMENTARY

Extended reflection.  
Here you draw out themes, contrasts, spiritual principles, psychological insights, patterns, and theological resonance.  
This is the “teaching” section of the chapter — still poetic, but more discursive.

# IV. KJV ↔ BKV COMPARISON TABLE

| Verse | King James Version (KJV) | Bible Key Version (BKV) |
|-------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | … | … |
| 2 | … | … |
| *etc.* | | |

Use this table to anchor the symbolic reading in the text itself.  
This also serves as a verse-by-verse guide for study.

---

# V. SYMBOLICS TABLE

| Symbol | Meaning | Scriptural Support |
|--------|---------|--------------------|
| Name / Place / Object | Faculty / State / Movement | References |

This table provides quick-reference clarity for readers.  
Great for cross-chapter patterns as BKV grows.

---

# VI. PROPHETIC SENTENCES

Many chapters contain one or more “prophetic sentences”:  
names, phrases, or declarations that crystallize the spiritual architecture.

Example pattern:

### **1. [Sentence Name] — “[Meaning]”**  
What it represents in the inner life.  
How it functions in the chapter.

### **2. [Second Sentence, if present]**  
Same as above.

Add as many as appropriate.  
These become anchor-points across entire books.

---

# IN SUMMARY

A closing section that gathers the chapter into a single thread.  
Short, distilled, reflective.  
This is the “integration” moment.

Focus on:

- the inner pattern  
- the spiritual principle  
- how Presence meets the soul  
- how the chapter moves from misalignment → alignment  

No new teaching — just **distillation.**
