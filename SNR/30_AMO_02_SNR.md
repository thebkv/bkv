AMOS 2 — SYMBOLIC NATURAL READING (SNR)
==================================================

For three transgressions of Moab, and for four,
judgment is released.
What was already finished is violated again,
and contempt crosses even the boundary of death.
The stronghold falls,
and the ruler is cut off in the midst of upheaval.

For three transgressions of Judah, and for four,
judgment is not withheld.
Instruction is rejected,
the law is cast aside,
and the same deceptions of former generations are followed.
Fire comes upon Jerusalem,
and its palaces are consumed.

For three transgressions of Israel, and for four,
judgment turns inward.
The righteous are sold for silver,
and the needy for a pair of sandals.
The poor are crushed into the dust,
and the afflicted are pushed aside.
Sacred space is used without restraint,
and worship is separated from justice.

Yet I destroyed the Amorite before you,
strong as cedars and tall as oaks.
I cut off his fruit above and his root below.
I brought you up from Egypt
and led you through the wilderness forty years,
to possess the land prepared for you.

I raised up prophets among you
and Nazirites from your young men.
But the prophets were silenced,
and the Nazirites were corrupted.
The safeguards were rejected.

Now I will press you down
as a cart presses when full of grain.
The swift will not escape,
the strong will not prevail,
and the warrior will flee in that day.

Strength without alignment cannot stand.
Privilege ignored becomes weight.
Judgment falls not from ignorance,
but from truth known and refused.
