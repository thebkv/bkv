AMOS 1 — SYMBOLIC NATURAL READING (SNR)
==================================================

The words of Amos, a shepherd from Tekoa, spoken in days when the land
appeared stable, yet tremors lay beneath the surface.

The LORD roars from Zion
and utters His voice from Jerusalem.
The pastures of the shepherds mourn,
and the summit of Carmel dries.

For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four,
judgment is no longer restrained.
Cruelty has become a method,
and strength is used without mercy.
The stronghold is broken,
the ruler is cut off,
and those who trusted in force are carried away.

For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four,
judgment proceeds.
Human lives are traded as goods,
and captivity becomes commerce.
The cities fall,
the remnant of power is consumed,
and the gates are burned with fire.

For three transgressions of Tyre, and for four,
judgment is released.
Covenant is forgotten,
and brotherhood is sold for advantage.
The walls are devoured,
and the fortified city is undone.

For three transgressions of Edom, and for four,
judgment follows.
Mercy is cast aside,
anger is preserved,
and pursuit never ceases.
Wrath is kept without limit,
and the strongholds are consumed.

For three transgressions of Ammon, and for four,
judgment is sealed.
Life is destroyed to widen borders,
and violence is used to secure gain.
The king and princes are swept away together
in the day of upheaval.

Thus the LORD speaks.
Each nation falls by its own imbalance.
The same fire that destroys also refines.
Judgment is not sudden,
but arrives when restraint is exhausted.
