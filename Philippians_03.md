# Philippians 3 — BKV Study  
## *Losing the False Self, Gaining the True Self, and Pressing Toward the Heavenly Calling*

---

# **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

1. Finally, my brethren, **rejoice in the Lord**.  
   To write the same things to you again is not burdensome,  
   and for you it is **safe**.

2. **Beware of the dogs**,  
   beware of the **evil workers**,  
   beware of the **concision**.

3. For we are the **circumcision**,  
   who **worship God in the Spirit**,  
   and **rejoice in Christ Jesus**,  
   and have **no confidence in the flesh**.

4. Though I myself could have confidence in the flesh —  
   if anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh,  
   **I far more**:

5. Circumcised the eighth day,  
   of the **stock of Israel**,  
   of the tribe of **Benjamin**,  
   a **Hebrew of Hebrews**;  
   as to the law, a **Pharisee**;

6. Concerning zeal, **persecuting the church**;  
   concerning the righteousness which is in the law,  
   **blameless**.

7. But whatever things were gain to me,  
   I counted as **loss** for **Christ**.

8. Yes indeed, I count **all things loss**  
   for the excellence of the **knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord**,  
   for whom I have suffered the loss of all things,  
   and count them as **refuse**,  
   that I may **gain Christ**,

9. And be found **in Him**,  
   not having my own righteousness from the law,  
   but that which is through **faith in Christ**,  
   the righteousness that is from God by faith,

10. That I may **know Him**,  
    and the **power of His resurrection**,  
    and the **fellowship of His sufferings**,  
    being **conformed to His death**,

11. If by any means  
    I may attain to the **resurrection from the dead**.

---

## **Pressing Toward the Mark**

12. Not that I have already attained,  
    or am already perfected,  
    but I **press on**,  
    that I may **lay hold** of that  
    for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me.

13. Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended;  
    but this one thing I do:  
    **forgetting those things which are behind**,  
    and **reaching forward to those things which are before**,

14. I **press toward the mark**  
    for the **prize of the upward calling of God in Christ Jesus**.

15. Therefore, let **as many as are mature** be thus minded;  
    and if in anything you think differently,  
    God will reveal this also to you.

16. Only let us **walk** by the same rule,  
    let us **mind** the same thing.

## **Two Citizenships**

17. Brethren, be **imitators together of me**,  
    and mark those who walk so,  
    as you have us for an example.

18. For many walk,  
    of whom I told you often,  
    and now tell you even weeping,  
    that they are **enemies of the cross of Christ**:

19. Whose **end is destruction**,  
    whose **god is their appetite**,  
    whose **glory is in their shame**,  
    whose **mind is on earthly things**.

20. For our **citizenship is in heaven**,  
    from which we eagerly await the Savior,  
    the Lord Jesus Christ,

21. Who will **transform our lowly body**  
    so that it may be **conformed to His glorious body**,  
    according to the power by which  
    He is able even to **subdue all things** to Himself.

# **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**  
### *Poetic Alignment*

- Beware of the voices  
  that slice without healing.

- True circumcision  
  is not of skin  
  but of **confidence** —  
  cutting away trust in the flesh.

- Paul’s entire résumé  
  becomes refuse  
  beside the excellence of knowing Christ.

- To know Him  
  is to enter the pattern:  
  **death → resurrection → transformation**.

- Maturity forgets the past  
  and leans toward the future.  
  The soul is shaped  
  by the direction it is pointed.

- Two citizenships call us:  
  one downward,  
  one upward.

- The prize is not escape  
  but **conformation** to His image.

# **Commentary Summary**

### **1. Paul’s résumé is a map of the false self.**  
Every advantage he had — birth, tribe, education, zeal — he counts as **loss**.  
This is not self-hatred; it’s clarity:  
**the flesh cannot build righteousness.**

### **2. “Knowing Christ” is the center of the chapter.**  
Not knowing *about* Him — but knowing Him:

- power of His resurrection  
- fellowship of His sufferings  
- conformity to His death  

This is the soul’s pattern of transformation.

### **3. The Christian life is directional.**  
Paul’s “pressing toward the mark” is not striving for acceptance but **moving toward the identity already given**.

### **4. Two citizenships are always competing.**  
Earthly-mindedness → appetite, shame, destruction.  
Heavenly-mindedness → transformation, hope, stability.

### **5. Christ’s transformative power is the final word.**  
He will subdue **all things** — including the last remnants of the old identity.
