# Philippians 4 — BKV Study  
## *Steadfastness, Peace, Thought, Provision*

---

# **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

1. Therefore, my brethren,  
   beloved and longed for,  
   **my joy and crown**,  
   stand fast in the Lord,  
   my beloved.

2. I urge **Euodia** (“**Sweet Fragrance**”)  
   and I urge **Syntyche** (“**Common Fate / Shared Fortune**”)  
   to be of the **same mind** in the Lord.

3. And I ask you also,  
   true companion,  
   help these women  
   who have labored with me in the gospel,  
   with **Clement** (“**Merciful / Mild**”) also,  
   and the rest of my fellow-workers,  
   whose names are in the book of life.

## **Rejoicing and the Presence of the Lord**

4. Rejoice in the Lord always;  
   again I say, rejoice.

5. Let your **gentleness** be known to all.  
   The Lord is **near**.

6. Be anxious for nothing,  
   but in everything,  
   by prayer  
   and supplication  
   with thanksgiving,  
   let your requests  
   be made known to God.

7. And the **peace of God**,  
   which surpasses all understanding,  
   will **guard**  
   your hearts and minds  
   in Christ Jesus.

---

## **The Discipline of Thought**

8. Finally, brethren,  
   whatever things are **true**,  
   honorable,  
   just,  
   pure,  
   lovely,  
   of good report —  
   if there is **any virtue**,  
   and anything worthy of praise —  
   **think on these things.**

9. The things you learned,  
   received,  
   heard,  
   and saw in me —  
   practice these,  
   and the God of peace  
   will be with you.

---

## **The Secret of Contentment**

10. I rejoiced greatly  
    that your care for me  
    has flourished again.  
    You lacked opportunity,  
    not willingness.

11. Not that I speak from want;  
    for I have learned,  
    in whatever state I am,  
    to be **content**.

12. I know how to be abased,  
    and I know how to abound.  
    Everywhere and in all things  
    I have learned both to be full  
    and to be hungry,  
    both to abound  
    and to suffer need.

13. I can do all things  
    through **Christ**  
    who strengthens me.

## **The Gift as True Worship**

15. In the beginning of the gospel,  
    when I departed from Macedonia,  
    no church shared with me  
    concerning giving and receiving  
    but you only.

16. Even in Thessalonica  
    you sent once and again  
    to my necessity.

17. Not because I desire a gift,  
    but I seek the **fruit**  
    that abounds to your account.

18. I have everything;  
    I abound.  
    I am full,  
    having received from **Epaphroditus**  
    the things sent from you,  
    a **fragrant offering**,  
    acceptable and well-pleasing to God.

19. And my God  
    will supply all your need  
    according to His riches  
    in glory in Christ Jesus.

---

## **Final Blessing**

21. Greet every saint.  
22. All the saints greet you,  
    especially those of **Caesar’s household**.

23. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ  
    be with your spirit.

# **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**  
### *Poetic Alignment*

- Two divided hearts (**Euodia** & **Syntyche**)  
  must become one fragrance again.

- Anxiety unravels  
  where prayer and thanksgiving meet.

- Peace becomes  
  not a feeling  
  but a **guard** —  
  a sentry posted over the heart.

- Thought is the doorway of the soul.  
  To think rightly  
  is to breathe rightly.

- Contentment is not natural —  
  it is learned.  
  A posture, not a mood.

- Giving is worship  
  when it becomes a **fragrant offering**.

- The God of peace  
  is not distant —  
  He is **near**,  
  within reach of a gentle heart.
