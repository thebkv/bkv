🎙️ **INTRODUCTION**

Imagine with me for a moment that we’re opening a small scroll from the early days after the exile — written by a man who actually lived through that time. These are his words about the prophet Yehezkel.

📜 **The Zadokite of Tel-abib: A Post-Exilic Account of the Prophet Yehezkel**

As one living in these restored days—some sixty years after the last visions of Yehezkel ben-Buzi—I set down what our elders still recall of the strange, fierce man who walked among the exiles. Even now, people argue about him. Some whisper he was touched by madness. Others swear the breath of the LORD rested on him more heavily than on any man since Moses. Either way, no one forgets him.

## 🌎 Ezekiel’s World: The Banks of the Chebar Canal

Yehezkel lived and spoke in the land of the Chaldeans, near a settlement we call Tel-abib, beside the waters of the Chebar. He was taken with King Jehoiachin **in the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and six years before the fall of Jerusalem**. That moment shaped everything that followed.

### Life in Exile

**A Colony Without Bars:**  
The Judeans were not chained, yet they were far from free. Babylon planted them in fields and villages, expecting them to work the land. They built homes, hauled water, dug canals, and learned to live as strangers in a world that was not theirs.

**The Work:**  
Most farmed grain or tended orchards. Some carved stone. Some baked bricks. They lived under ration tablets and officials who recorded everything.

**The Spiritual Wound:**  
Their greatest pain was not labor, but loss.  
The Temple—the house of God—was gone.  
Many wondered quietly if the LORD had left them forever. Others feared He had been defeated by the gods of Babylon. Hope was thin. Songs were rare.

Into that heaviness walked Yehezkel.

## 👤 The Man: Yehezkel ben-Buzi

**The Priest:**  
Yehezkel was born into the line of Zadok. He was trained for the holy things from childhood. When he turned thirty—the age when a priest should begin full service—there was no Temple for him to serve in. This ache lived deep in him, and it shaped everything he said.

**The Husband:**  
He was married, and those who knew him say he loved his wife with a quiet devotion. When she died without warning, he was forbidden by God to mourn openly. Many of us look back on that moment as the turning point in his ministry. Something in him sharpened, like a blade.

**The Scholar of the Exile:**  
He listened to the stories of the Chaldeans—their tales of heroes, storms, and heavenly beings—and he wrestled with them. He learned their phrases. He watched their festivals. He understood their imagination, yet he never bowed to their gods.

**The Performer — Strange, Bold, Impossible to Ignore:**  
Now this must be said plainly:  
**Yehezkel was odd. Gloriously odd. Shakespeare would have written whole plays about him.**

He acted his messages out:

- He built a tiny clay model of Jerusalem and pretended to besiege it in front of everyone.  
- He lay on his side for so long people had to come check if he was alive.  
- He rationed his food until he looked thin as a shadow.  
- He shaved his head and beard with a sword and scattered the hair to the wind.  
- He packed a traveler’s bag, dug a hole through the wall of his house, and crawled out in the night like a man escaping a siege.

Children whispered that he was strange.  
Adults followed him anyway.

Some called him mad.  
Some called him the Watchman.  
Some avoided him, afraid he could see right through them.

Yet no one—not even the Babylonians—shrugged him off.

## 🗣️ His Prophecy: Judgment and Radical Hope

His ministry lasted more than twenty years, and everyone agrees it fell into two very different chapters.

### Phase I — The Watchman of Doom  
**(from the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar until the fall of Jerusalem)**

Before Jerusalem fell, Yehezkel spoke only of judgment.  
The people hoped the city would be saved; he told them it would burn.  
They waited for a miracle; he said none would come.  
He described the glory of the LORD lifting off the Temple and leaving it behind. That frightened even the elders, who had always believed God never moved.

### Phase II — The Voice of Restoration  
**(after the fall of the city until the end of his ministry)**

Once the refugees arrived with the terrible news, Yehezkel changed completely.  
The fire left his voice, and warmth returned.

He spoke of rebuilding:

**Individual Responsibility:**  
Every person would answer for his own life. No more blaming fathers or sons.

**The New Heart:**  
God Himself would give the people a heart of flesh instead of stone.

**The Valley of Dry Bones:**  
He saw Israel as a field of bones—dead, forgotten—until the breath of God turned them into a living army.

**The New Temple:**  
His last visions stunned many of us. He described a Temple larger than anything Solomon built—measured, ordered, holy. A picture not only of stone, but of the world made right.

Some scribes say we will never build it exactly as he saw it.  
But everyone agrees the vision keeps our hope alive.

## 🏛️ His Legacy Among Us

Now that we rebuild the altar in the land, we do so beneath Yehezkel’s shadow.  
Some say he saw too far.  
Some say he saw exactly enough.  
But none deny this:

**He taught us that God was not lost when the Temple fell.  
He walked into exile with us.  
He walks into restoration with us still.**

And for all his strangeness—for all the stories of clay models, sword-haircuts, and lying in the dirt—Yehezkel ben-Buzi is the reason many of us believe the LORD has not abandoned His people, even after everything we have endured.
