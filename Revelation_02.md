# Revelation 2  
## *Messages to the Seven **States of Consciousness***  

# BKV Translation

### **1 · To the State of Consciousness called Ephesus**

Unto the **Guiding Principle** of the **State of Returning to First Love** write:

“These things says the One who holds the **Seven Guiding Principles** in His **Right Hand of Authority**, who walks in the midst of the **Seven Principles of Light**:

I know your **Disciplined Actions**, your **Labor**, and your **Endurance**, and how you cannot bear those thoughts that are false; and you have tested the claims of those impulses that say they are **Apostolic Principles**, and are not, and you found them wanting.

You have borne burdens and endured for the sake of My **Name-Principle**, and have not grown weary.

Nevertheless, I have this against you: you have left your **First Love**—your original flame of affection for the **Divine Self**.

Remember, therefore, from where you have fallen; return to your **First Conscious Attention**, and do the **Foundational Actions**; or else I will come unto you quickly, and will remove your **Principle of Light** out of its place, unless you return.

But this you have: you reject the deeds of the **Nicolaitan Tendency**—the impulse toward spiritual hierarchy and domination—which I also reject.

He that has **Spiritual Hearing**, let him hear what the **Spirit** says to the **States of Consciousness**.  
To the one who overcomes, I will grant to eat of the **Tree of Life**—the Principle of Living Union—which is in the **Inner Paradise of the Absolute Source**.”

---

### **2 · To the State of Consciousness called Smyrna**

Unto the **Guiding Principle** of the **State of Faith Under Pressure** write:

“These things says the **First and the Last**, the One who became as dead and is alive again:

I know your **Inner Pressure**, and your **Poverty**—yet you are rich.  
I know the slander of the tendency that claims connection with the **Inner Covenant**, but is governed by the **Opposing Impulse**.

Fear none of the things you are about to suffer. Behold, the **Adversarial Force** will cast some of you into **Inner Confinement**, that you may be tested; and you shall have **Tribulation Ten Days**—a complete cycle of pressure.

Be faithful unto the **Threshold of Death**—the surrender of the **Egoic Will**—and I will give you the **Crown of Life**.

He who has **Spiritual Hearing**, let him hear what the **Spirit** says to the **States of Consciousness**.  
The one who overcomes shall not be harmed by the **Second Death**—the dissolution of the false identity.”

---

### **3 · To the State of Consciousness called Pergamum**

Unto the **Guiding Principle** of the **State of Living Amidst Inner Conflict** write:

“These things says the One who has the **Sharp Two-Edged Sword of Truth**:

I know where you dwell—where the **Seat of the Fragmenting Impulse** is.  
Yet you hold fast My **Name-Principle**, and have not denied My **Living Witness**, even in the days of the **Faithful Faculty**, who was pressed to death among you where the **Fragmenting Impulse** resides.

But I have a few things against you: you harbor the **Teaching of Balaam-Tendency**—the compromise that entangles consciousness with the lower impulses—and the **Teaching of the Nicolaitans**, which works the same corruption.

Return from this compromise; or else I will come unto you quickly, and will fight against these tendencies with the **Sword of My Mouth**.

He who has **Spiritual Hearing**, let him hear what the **Spirit** says to the **States of Consciousness**.  
To the one who overcomes will I give the **Hidden Manna**—inner sustenance—and a **White Stone** with a **New Name** written on it, which no faculty knows except the one who receives it.”

---

### **4 · To the State of Consciousness called Thyatira**

Unto the **Guiding Principle** of the **State of Active Love Under Seduction** write:

“These things says the **Divine Self**, whose eyes are as a **Flame of Fire**, and whose feet are like **Burnished Bronze**:

I know your **Love**, your **Service**, your **Faith**, your **Endurance**, and that your latter works exceed the first.

Nevertheless, you allow the **Seductive Impulse**—symbolized by **Jezebel-Tendency**—which calls itself **Prophetic** but leads the faculties astray, teaching compromise with the lower appetites.

I gave this impulse space to return, but it did not.  
Behold, I will cast it into a **Bed of Tribulation**, and those tendencies that join with it into pressure, unless they turn from their works.

And the **Offspring of this Impulse**—the patterns it produces—I will bring to an end, and all the **States of Consciousness** shall know that I am the One who searches the **Hearts** and the **Inner Intentions**, and I will give to each faculty according to its works.

But to you who do not hold this teaching, I place no further burden—only hold fast what you have until I come.

To the one who overcomes and keeps My works to the end, I will give **Authority Over the Inner Patternings**; and this one shall rule them with a **Rod of Iron-Principle**, shattering false structures as vessels of clay, even as I have received from My **Absolute Source**.

And I will give this one the **Morning Star**—the dawning of the **Divine Self** within.

He who has **Spiritual Hearing**, let him hear what the **Spirit** says to the **States of Consciousness**.”

# Revelation 2 — BKV Study
## *The Refinement of the Seven Inner States*

> _“He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.”_ — Revelation 2:7

Once the **Divine Self** is unveiled in Revelation 1, the next movement is **inner correction**. Revelation 2 is not spoken to the outer world; it is spoken to the **seven inner states of consciousness**. Each receives:

- a commendation,  
- an exposure of distortion,  
- a call to return,  
- and a promise of renewal.

This is not punishment.  
This is alignment.  
This is the **Spirit** walking among the **Principles of Light**, tuning each lamp until the whole soul burns true.

---

# **The Four States Addressed in Revelation 2**

## **1 · Ephesus — The State of Returning to First Love**
### *Distortion: Doing without affection.*  
### *Renewal: Recovered motive.*

The **State of Ephesus** works hard, discerns well, and endures faithfully — yet quietly loses the warmth that once powered everything.  
The issue is not effort; it is **motive**.

The **Divine Self** calls this state back to its **First Love** — that primal affection that makes obedience joyful rather than mechanical.

The promise is the **Tree of Life** — the restoration of motive rooted directly in the Source.

**Movement:** From **obedience by strength** → to **obedience by love**.

---

## **2 · Smyrna — The State of Faith Under Pressure**
### *Distortion: Fear of loss.*  
### *Renewal: Unshakeable endurance.*

The **State of Smyrna** faces pressure, poverty, accusations, and confinement.  
Everything feels like loss.

Yet the Divine Self says, “You are rich.”

This faculty discovers that the furnace of affliction is the birthplace of the **Crown of Life** — a consciousness that knows death cannot undo what God has made alive.

**Movement:** From **fear of suffering** → to **authority over suffering**.

---

## **3 · Pergamum — The State of Living Amidst Inner Conflict**
### *Distortion: Mixture and compromise.*  
### *Renewal: Discernment and clarity.*

The **State of Pergamum** dwells “where the **Seat of the Fragmenting Impulse** is.”  
This is where the mind is constantly pulled by competing desires and ideas.

Its danger is **accommodation** — blending truth with convenience.

Here, the **Sword of Truth** must cut cleanly.

The promises are the **Hidden Manna** and the **White Stone** with a **New Name** — nourishment, clarity, and identity untainted by compromise.

**Movement:** From **double-mindedness** → to **single clarity**.

---

## **4 · Thyatira — The State of Active Love Under Seduction**
### *Distortion: Emotion ungoverned by truth.*  
### *Renewal: Purified affection.*

The **State of Thyatira** is full of love, service, faith, and endurance — yet allows a **Seductive Impulse** to function as if it were prophetic.

This is the emotional life when it becomes misaligned — compassion drifting into flattery, kindness enabling dysfunction, desire wearing the mask of discernment.

The **Divine Self**, with eyes as a **Flame of Fire**, confronts distortion at its root.

The promise is the **Morning Star** — the first light of a heart governed by truth.

**Movement:** From **feeling as authority** → to **truth purifying feeling**.

---

# **Commentary Overview — The Inner Logic of Revelation 2**

### **A. The Pattern**
Each inner state follows the same spiritual rhythm:

1. **Affirmation** — what is already functioning in truth  
2. **Exposure** — the distortion blocking growth  
3. **Call to return** — the correction needed  
4. **Promise** — the transformation that follows

This is the anatomy of **spiritual refinement**.

---

### **B. The Movement from Revelation 1 → 2**
Revelation 1 unveils the **Divine Self** among the **Principles of Light**.

Revelation 2 reveals what happens next:  
He begins to speak to each light **individually**.

The movement is from **vision** to **alignment**,  
from **seeing Christ** to **becoming Christ-shaped**,  
from **illumination** to **integration**.

The order matters:

- **Ephesus**: motive  
- **Smyrna**: endurance  
- **Pergamum**: clarity  
- **Thyatira**: affection  

These are the first four pillars of inner mastery.

---

# **Core BKV Principle for Revelation 2**

> The **Divine Self** addresses each inner state, not to condemn, but to restore.  
> The **Will** must love again;  
> **Faith** must endure;  
> the **Mind** must discern;  
> the **Heart** must burn clean.  
> Revelation 2 is the Spirit walking through the inner sanctuary, rekindling every lamp until the whole soul shines with unified light.
