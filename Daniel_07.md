_“You saw the Son of Man on the clouds…”_
_“Now go possess that identity in the land.”_

1. In the first year of Belshazzar, king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay in his bed. Then he wrote down the dream and told the sum of the matter.  
2. Daniel declared, “I saw in my vision by night, and behold, the **four winds of heaven** were stirring up the **great sea** (**the chaotic, undifferentiated depths of the mind**).  
3. And four great **beasts** (**expressions of the lower nature**), different from one another, came up out of the sea.  
4. The first was like a **lion** (**the prideful, dominant ego**) and had **eagles' wings**. Then as I looked its wings were plucked off, and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on two feet like a man, and a human mind was given to it.  
5. And behold, another beast, a second one, like a **bear** (**the devouring, materialistic ego**). It was raised up on one side; it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, ‘Arise, devour much flesh.’  
6. After this I looked, and behold, another, like a **leopard** (**the deceptive, fractured ego**), with four wings of a bird on its back. And the beast had four heads, and **dominion** (**power**) was given to it.  
7. After this I saw in the night visions, and behold, a **fourth beast**, the **unnamable amalgam of destructive forces**. It had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and stamped what was left with its feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it, and it had ten **horns**.  
8. I considered the horns, and behold, there came up among them another horn, a **little one**, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things (**a pretender consciousness**).  
9. “As I looked, **thrones** (**seats of inner power**) were placed, and the **Ancient of Days** (**Eternal Source of Order**) took his seat; his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head was like pure wool; his throne was **fiery flames**; its **wheels** were **burning fire**.  
10. A **stream of fire** issued and came out from before him; a thousand thousands served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him; the court sat in judgment, and the **books were opened** (**the unveiling of the hidden record of consciousness**).  
11. “I looked then because of the sound of the great words that the horn was speaking. And as I looked, the beast was slain, and its body destroyed and given over to be burned with fire.  
12. As for the rest of the beasts, their **dominion** (**power**) was taken away, but their lives were prolonged for a season and a time (**though stripped of power, residual ego states persist temporarily, awaiting full integration**).  
13. “I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the **clouds of heaven** there came one like a **Son of Man** (**the Divine-Human Principle / Higher Self**), and he came to the **Ancient of Days** and was presented before him.  
14. And to him was given **dominion** and **glory** and a **kingdom** (**spiritual authority and integration**), that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed.
