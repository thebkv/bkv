## Matthew 1 (BKV Symbolic-Only Restatement)

1. This is the record of **Yahweh Saves**, the **Anointed** — descended through **Love** and through **Faith**.  

2. **Faith** fathered **Laughter**; **Laughter** fathered **Supplanter**; **Supplanter** fathered **Praise** and his brothers.  

3. **Praise** fathered **Breach** and **Rising** by **Palm Tree**; **Breach** fathered **Enclosure**; **Enclosure** fathered **Exalted**.  

4. **Exalted** fathered **My People Are Noble**; **My People Are Noble** fathered **Oracle**; **Oracle** fathered **Covering**.  

5. **Covering** fathered **Strength** by **Broad/Open**; **Strength** fathered **Servant** by **Friendship**; **Servant** fathered **Wealth/Being**.  

6. **Wealth/Being** fathered **Love**, the king; **Love** fathered **Peace** by the woman who had been the wife of **Light**.  

7. **Peace** fathered Rehoboam; Rehoboam fathered Abijah; Abijah fathered Asa.  

8. Asa fathered Jehoshaphat; Jehoshaphat fathered Joram; Joram fathered Uzziah.  

9. Uzziah fathered Jotham; Jotham fathered Ahaz; Ahaz fathered Hezekiah.  

10. Hezekiah fathered Manasseh; Manasseh fathered Amon; Amon fathered Josiah.  

11. Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brothers, at _the time of_ **Bondage** in Babylon.  

12. After **Bondage**: Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel; Shealtiel fathered **Sown in Babylon**.  

13. **Sown in Babylon** fathered Abiud; Abiud fathered Eliakim; Eliakim fathered Azor.  

14. Azor fathered Zadok; Zadok fathered Achim; Achim fathered Eliud.  

15. Eliud fathered Eleazar; Eleazar fathered Matthan; Matthan fathered **Supplanter**.  

16. **Supplanter** fathered **Increase**, the husband of Mary, from whom was born **Yahweh Saves**, who is called the **Anointed**.  

17. So all the generations from **Faith** to **Love** were fourteen; from **Love** to **Bondage**, fourteen; and from **Bondage** to the **Anointed**, fourteen.  

18. The birth of **Yahweh Saves**, the **Anointed**, happened this way: Mary, pledged to **Increase**, was found with child through the Holy Spirit before they came together.  

19. **Increase**, being just and unwilling to disgrace her, resolved to put her away quietly.  

20. But as he considered this, a messenger of the Lord appeared in a dream, saying, “**Increase**, son of **Love**, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.”  

21. “She will bear a son, and you shall call his name **Yahweh Saves**, for he will save his people from their sins.”  

22. All this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet:  

23. “Behold, the virgin will conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name **God With Us**.”  

24. When **Increase** awoke from sleep, he did as the messenger commanded him and took Mary as his wife.  

25. But he did not know her until she had borne a son, and he called his name **Yahweh Saves**.
