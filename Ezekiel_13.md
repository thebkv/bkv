# Ezekiel 13

## **BKV (Bible Key Version)**

1. And the word of the **Absolute Source** came to me, saying,
2. **True Consciousness**, speak out against the **deceptive thoughts** within the state of **spiritual consciousness**—those which speak from their own limited, egoic desires. Hear the word of the **Absolute Source**;
3. Thus says the **Absolute Source**: Misfortune upon the **foolish thoughts** that are guided by their own will, and which have no true spiritual insight!
4. O **Spiritual Consciousness**, your **deceptive thoughts** are like fleeting, scavenging ideas in a barren state of mind.
5. You have not closed the gaps in your inner defenses, nor built a firm hedge for the **spiritual consciousness** to stand firm in the day of inner testing.
6. They have indulged in **self-delusion** and **lying pronouncements**, saying, “The **Absolute Source** has spoken!” yet the **Absolute Source** has not sent them. And they have caused others to cling to the false hope that their words are true.
7. Have you not been lost in a **vain vision** and spoken a **deceptive thought**, while you claim, “The **Absolute Source** has said it,” even though I have not spoken?
8. Therefore, thus says the **Absolute Source**: Because you have spoken falsehood and seen lies, behold, I am against you, says the **Absolute Source**.
9. And my hand shall be upon the **deceptive thoughts** that indulge in self-delusion and utter lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my true inner faculties, neither shall they be recorded in the life-story of the **spiritual consciousness**, nor shall they enter into the state of **inner union**. And you shall know that I am the **Absolute Source**.
10. Because, indeed, they have led my inner faculties astray by saying, “All is at peace,” when there was no inner peace. And when a person begins to establish an inner **wall** of truth, others come and plaster it over with **unstable, superficial belief**.
11. Say to those who plaster over a spiritual foundation with **unstable, superficial belief**, that it will surely collapse. There shall come an overwhelming flood of truth, and you, as great, heavy insights of realization, shall fall; and a powerful inner wind will tear it asunder.
12. Behold, when that **wall** has fallen, will it not be said to you, “Where is the superficial belief with which you covered it?”
13. Therefore, thus says the **Absolute Source**: I will surely tear it apart with a powerful inner wind in my fervor; and there shall be an overwhelming flood of cleansing truth in my indignation, and great, heavy insights of realization in my purifying fire to completely destroy it.
14. So I will break down the **wall** that you have covered with **unstable, superficial belief**, and bring it down to the ground, so that its very **foundation** will be revealed. And it shall fall, and you who upheld it shall be consumed in its midst. And you shall know that I am the **Absolute Source**.
15. Thus will I complete my resolve upon the **wall**, and upon those who have covered it with **unstable, superficial belief**, and I will say to you, “The **wall** is no more, nor those who concealed it;”
16. Namely, the **deceptive thoughts** of the state of **spiritual consciousness** which claim to see a vision of inner peace, when there is no true peace, says the **Absolute Source**.
17. Likewise, you **True Consciousness**, set your focus against those parts of your inner self that are guided by their own ego and speak from their own desires; and speak against them,
18. And say, “Thus says the **Absolute Source**: Misfortune to the thoughts that provide **false comfort** in every weak point, and that create a one-size-fits-all, limiting belief system upon the mind of every person, thereby trapping souls! Will you truly trap the souls of my inner faculties, and will you save alive the souls that come to you for help?”
19. And will you degrade my truth among my inner faculties for a little superficial knowledge and a few meager comforting ideas, in order to stifle the souls that should be in a state of full life, and to sustain the souls that should not remain in their false state, by your lies to my faculties who hear your lies?
20. Therefore, thus says the **Absolute Source**: Behold, I am against your **false comforts**, with which you entrap souls and prevent them from ascending, and I will tear them from your embrace, and I will let the souls go free, even the souls that you trap to prevent them from ascending.
21. Your **limiting belief systems** also will I tear, and I will deliver my inner faculties out of your control, and they shall no longer be in your control; and you shall know that I am the **Absolute Source**.
22. Because with lies you have made the heart of the right-aligned conscious mind sad, whom I have not made sad; and you have strengthened the will of the unrighteous, preventing it from returning from its unrighteous path, by promising it life in its state of error.
23. Therefore you shall no longer indulge in **self-delusion** or utter lies. For I will deliver my inner faculties from your control; and you shall know that I am the **Absolute Source**.

## **Interpretive Summary**

Ezekiel 13 is a powerful spiritual warning against self-deception and the dangers of a flimsy spiritual foundation. The **false prophets** are not just historical figures but represent any thought, belief, or external influence that promises spiritual well-being without requiring genuine inner work and surrender. This could be a part of the self that indulges in wishful thinking, or an external doctrine that offers superficial comfort.

The core metaphor of the chapter is the **wall built with untempered mortar**. The **wall** is a person's inner belief system, their spiritual edifice. **Untempered mortar** represents weak, ungrounded, or false beliefs that are used to hold this structure together. The **Absolute Source** warns that this wall will not stand when the **inner storms and floods of life** inevitably come. These storms are the tests, challenges, and moments of crisis that reveal the inadequacy of a spiritual life built on lies and easy platitudes. The **foundations** will be exposed, and the entire structure will collapse, bringing ruin to those who relied upon it.

The chapter also introduces vivid symbols of false comfort: **pillows sewn at the armholes** and **kerchiefs on the head**. These represent providing a state of **false spiritual ease** and a **one-size-fits-all, superficial teaching** that placates the ego and avoids true transformation. The "hunting of souls" refers to the ego's desire to control and mislead its own inner faculties, rather than setting them free to ascend. The ultimate message is that true spiritual authority and deliverance come only from a genuine and unwavering alignment with the **Absolute Source**, which will not tolerate a spiritual life built on lies and complacency.

## **Original Text: Ezekiel 13 (King James Version)**

1. And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying,
2. Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the LORD;
3. Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!
4. O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.
5. Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.
6. They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD saith: and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.
7. Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith it; albeit I have not spoken?
8. Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord GOD.
9. And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
10. Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built a wall, and, lo, others daubed it with untempered mortar:
11. Say unto them which daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.
12. Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?
13. Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.
14. So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
15. Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered mortar, and will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;
16. To wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord GOD.
17. Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,
18. And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will ye hunt the souls of my people, and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you?
19. And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?
20. Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly.
21. Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
22. Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:
23. Therefore ye shall see no more vanity, nor divine lies: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
