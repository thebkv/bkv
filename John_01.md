# John 1 — BKV


**Original Text of John 1**

The Gospel of John begins with a prologue (verses 1-18) that introduces Jesus as the Word (Logos) who was with God and was God, through whom all things were created. It describes the Word's relationship to light and darkness and the role of John the Baptist as a witness to the true light. The chapter then details how the Word "became flesh" and how John the Baptist identifies Jesus as the "Lamb of God." Finally, Jesus begins to gather his first disciples, including Andrew, Peter, Philip, and Nathanael, revealing his divine insight into their true nature.

### **The BKV Translation of John 1**

**1:1-3**
In the beginning was the **Divine Principle**, and the Divine Principle was with the **Absolute**, and the Divine Principle **was** the Absolute. This Principle was in the beginning with the Absolute. All things were made through this Principle, and without it, nothing that is has been made.

**1:4-5**
In this Principle was **life**, and this life was the **true inner awareness of men**. This awareness shines in the **unconsciousness of the lower self**, and the lower self has not been able to overcome it.

**1:6-8**
There came an awakened thought in the mind, a forerunner called **John**, which represents the intellect in the process of becoming illumined. This thought came to bear witness to the true inner awareness, so that all might believe through its testimony. It was not the true awareness itself but came to bear witness to it.

**1:9-13**
The true inner awareness, the very principle that enlightens every person, was coming into the world, which is the collective human consciousness. It was in the world, and the world was made through it, but the world did not recognize it. It came to its own, and its own did not receive it. But to as many as received it, who believed in its fundamental nature, it gave them the authority to become **aligned with the Divine**, a destiny realized not through natural descent, nor the will of the flesh, nor the will of man, but **born of the Absolute**.

**1:14-18**
And the Divine Principle became a **fully embodied human consciousness** and dwelt within us, full of grace and truth. We have seen its glory, a glory like that of a single, perfect expression of the Absolute. And the illumined intellect testified to it, saying, “This is he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me has come into being before me, because he was before me.’” From its perfect embodiment of fullness we have all received grace upon grace. For the old law was given through the **intellectual self** (Moses), but grace and truth came through the **Consciousness-of-the-Divine**. No one has seen the Absolute at any time; the perfect expression of the Absolute, who is at the very core of the Father, has made it known.

**1:19-28**
This is the testimony of the illumined intellect, when the ingrained religious thoughts questioned its purpose. It confessed, “I am not the Christ.” It is merely the preparatory consciousness, the **“voice of one crying out in the wilderness,”** which is the undeveloped part of consciousness, calling for a clear path for the divine principle to enter. It is preparing the way for one more advanced than it, an inner authority to whom the intellect is not worthy to be subjected.

**1:29-34**
The next day, the illumined intellect saw the Consciousness-of-the-Divine coming toward it and exclaimed, **“Look! The pure life and substance of Being! The very principle of the Absolute that lifts up the separation of the world!”** It had seen the animating Spirit descend from the Heavens—the higher reaches of consciousness—and rest upon it, and knew with certainty that this was the one who purifies with true life. 

**1:35-51**
And the illumined intellect pointed out the Consciousness-of-the-Divine to its own principles. One of them, **Andrew** (strength of the mind), and **Simon** (faith), and **Philip** (power), and **Nathanael** (the imaging faculty), began to follow the divine consciousness, and it showed them the full potential of their own being. It saw through their outer appearances and gave them new names and new destinies, revealing their true nature from a higher dimension.

### **Interpretive Summary**

John 1 is a profound allegorical map of the birth of spiritual awareness within a person. It is not a historical biography, but a **diagram of the inner journey**.

* **The Logos/Word** (1:1-14) is the central principle. It is not a person from history but the **inherent Divine Idea** that underlies all of creation. This is the Christ Principle, the perfect blueprint of God's plan for humanity that becomes incarnate, or **embodied**, within the human consciousness.
* **Light and Darkness** (1:4-5) represent the fundamental opposition between spiritual awareness and the lower, unconscious self. The light of truth is always shining, even in our most ignorant states, and the darkness of our lower nature cannot extinguish it.
* **John the Baptist** (1:6) is a key archetype. He does not represent a person, but the **illumined intellect**. He is a necessary but limited state of mind that recognizes a higher truth and prepares the way for it. The intellect can point to the divine, but it is not the divine itself.
* **The Lamb of God** (1:29) symbolizes the **pure life force and substance of Being**. It is this innocent, guileless spiritual essence that, when fully activated in consciousness, has the power to overcome all inner separation and error.
* The calling of the first disciples is the activation of the core faculties of the soul. **Andrew (strength)**, **Simon/Peter (faith)**, **Philip (power)**, and **Nathanael (imagination)** are all aspects of the self that are brought into alignment with the Christ Consciousness. The narrative shows that as soon as these faculties align with the Divine, they are seen for their true purpose and given a new identity. The entire chapter is an inner journey of realizing that the Divine is not an external entity to be sought, but an innate reality to be awakened within.
