# John 1 — BKV-NR (Tuned)

1 In the beginning was the **Word — the divine pattern of all being**. The Word was with God, and the Word was God.  

2 He was in the beginning with God.  

3 Through him all things came into being; without him not one thing came into being.  

4 In him was **Life — the breath and spirit of God** — and that life was the **Light of humanity**.  

5 The **Light of divine awareness** shines in the **darkness of unformed thought**, and the darkness has not overcome it.  

6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was **God is Gracious**.  

7 He came as a **witness — a testifier to the Light**, that all might believe through him.  

8 He himself was not the Light, but came to bear witness to the Light.  

9 The true **Light, which illumines every person**, was coming into the world.  

10 He was in the **world — the outer manifestation of life**, and though the world was made through him, the world did not know him.  

11 He came to his own, and his own did not receive him.  

12 But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God.  

13 They were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.  

14 And the **Word — the divine pattern —** became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of **grace — God’s favor freely given — and truth — reality as it truly is**.  

15 **God is Gracious** bore witness of him and cried out, “This is he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me is before me, for he was before me.’”  

16 From his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace.  

17 For the **instruction** was given through **Drawn Out**; grace and truth came through Jesus the **Anointed One**.  

18 No one has ever seen God. The only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.  

19 This is the testimony of **God is Gracious**, when the **Separated Ones** and priests from **Foundation of Peace** sent to ask him, “Who are you?”  

20 He confessed, “I am not the **Anointed One**.”  

21 And they asked him, “What then? Are you **Jehovah is God**?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”  

22 Then they said, “Who are you? We must give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”  

23 He said, “I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way of the Lord,’ as said the prophet **Yahweh is Salvation**.”  

24 Now they had been sent from the **Separated Ones**.  

25 They asked him, “Why then do you baptize, if you are not the **Anointed One**, nor **Jehovah is God**, nor the Prophet?”  

26 **God is Gracious** answered, “I baptize with water; but among you stands one you do not know,  

27 the one coming after me, whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”  

28 These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where **God is Gracious** was baptizing.  

29 The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Behold, the **Lamb of God — the innocent life given —** who takes away the sin of the world!  

30 This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks before me, for he was before me.’  

31 I myself did not know him; but for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.”  

32 And **God is Gracious** bore witness: “I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.  

33 I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’  

34 And I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God.”  

35 The next day **God is Gracious** was standing with two of his disciples,  

36 and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, “Behold, the **Lamb of God**!”  

37 The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.  

38 Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, “What do you seek?” They said, “Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?”  

39 He said to them, “Come and see.” They came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.  

40 One of the two who heard **God is Gracious** speak and followed Jesus was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.  

41 He first found his brother Simon and said, “We have found the **Anointed One**.”  

42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John. You shall be called Cephas (which means Peter — the **Rock**).”  

43 The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.”  

44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the **House of Fishing**, the city of Andrew and Peter.  

45 Philip found Nathanael and said, “We have found him of whom **Drawn Out** in the **instruction**, and also the prophets, wrote — Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.”  

46 Nathanael said, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said, “Come and see.”  

47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming and said, “Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!”  

48 Nathanael said, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”  

49 Nathanael answered, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!”  

50 Jesus answered, “Because I said I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”  

51 And he said to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the **Reborn Human**.”
