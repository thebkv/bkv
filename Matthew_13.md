# Matthew 13 — BKV-NR (Tuned)

1 That same day Jesus went out of the **inner world** and sat by the **sea — the turmoil of unresolved personality**.  

2 Great crowds gathered to him, so that he got into a boat and sat down, and the whole crowd stood on the shore.  

3 And he told them many things in parables, saying:  
“A **sower** went out to sow.  

4 And as he sowed, some **seed — the word of God’s life —** fell on the **hard ground of the heart**, and the **distracting thoughts** came and snatched it away.  

5 Some fell on **shallow ground**, where the soil was thin. It sprang up quickly, but had no root.  

6 When the **sun of testing** rose, it was scorched; and because it had no depth, it withered away.  

7 Some fell among **thorns — the cares and riches of this world** — and the thorns grew up and choked it.  

8 But some fell on **good soil — a heart open to God —** and it bore fruit, a hundredfold, sixty, and thirty.  

9 He who has ears, let him hear.”  

10 The disciples came and said, “Why do you speak to them in parables?”  

11 He answered, “To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the **Inner Kingdom**, but to them it has not been given.  

12 For to the one who has, more will be given and he will have abundance; but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away.  

13 This is why I speak to them in parables:  
Seeing, they do not see; hearing, they do not hear, nor understand.  

14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of **Yahweh is Salvation**:  
‘You will hear and not understand,  
you will see and not perceive.  

15 For this people’s heart has grown dull,  
their ears are heavy,  
their eyes they have closed;  
lest they should see with their eyes,  
hear with their ears,  
understand with their heart,  
and turn, and I would heal them.’  

16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.  

17 Truly I say to you, many prophets and righteous longed to see what you see and did not, to hear what you hear and did not.”  

18 “Hear then the parable of the sower.  

19 When anyone hears the **word of the Inner Kingdom** and does not understand, the **evil one — the unresolved mind —** snatches away what was sown in the heart. This is the **seed on the hard ground**.  

20 The **seed on rocky ground** is the one who hears and receives with joy,  

21 yet has no root in himself. He endures for a while, but when trouble or persecution arises, he falls away.  

22 The **seed among thorns** is the one who hears, but the **cares of life and the lure of riches** choke the word, and it bears no fruit.  

23 But the **seed in good soil** is the one who hears and understands. He bears fruit — in one a hundredfold, in another sixty, in another thirty.”  

24 He put another parable before them, saying:  
“The **Inner Kingdom** is like a man who sowed good seed in his field.  

25 But while his men slept, an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.  

26 When the plants came up and bore grain, the weeds appeared also.  

27 The servants of the master said, ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed? How then are there weeds?’  

28 He said, ‘An enemy has done this.’ The servants asked, ‘Shall we pull them up?’  

29 But he said, ‘No, lest in pulling the weeds you root up the wheat also.  

30 Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will say to the reapers, “Gather the weeds first and bind them to burn, but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”  

31 He told them another parable:  
“The **Inner Kingdom** is like a mustard seed, the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows it becomes the largest of garden plants, a tree where the birds come and nest in its branches.”  

33 He told them another:  
“The **Inner Kingdom** is like leaven a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till all was leavened.”  

34 Jesus said all these things in parables to the crowds; without a parable he said nothing to them.  

35 This fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet:  
“I will open my mouth in parables;  
I will speak what has been hidden since the foundation of the world.”  

36 Then he left the crowd and went into the **inner world**. His disciples came and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds.”  

37 He answered, “The one who sows the good seed is the **Reborn Human**.  

38 The field is the **outer world**. The good seed are the children of the **Inner Kingdom**. The weeds are the children of the evil one.  

39 The enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.  

40 Just as the weeds are gathered and burned, so it will be at the close of the age.  

41 The **Reborn Human** will send his angels, and they will gather out of his **Inner Kingdom** all causes of sin and lawlessness,  

42 and throw them into the fiery furnace. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  

43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the **higher realm** of their **Father**. He who has ears, let him hear.  

44 “The **Inner Kingdom** is like treasure hidden in a field. A man found it, and in his joy he sold all he had and bought that field.  

45 Again, the **Inner Kingdom** is like a merchant seeking fine pearls.  

46 When he found one pearl of great price, he sold all he had and bought it.  

47 Again, the **Inner Kingdom** is like a net cast into the **sea of restless humanity**, gathering fish of every kind.  

48 When it was full, they drew it ashore, sat down, and sorted the good into vessels but threw away the bad.  

49 So it will be at the close of the age. The angels will separate the evil from the righteous  

50 and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  

51 Jesus said, “Have you understood all this?” They said, “Yes.”  

52 And he said, “Therefore every scribe trained for the **Inner Kingdom** is like a master of a house, bringing out of his treasure what is new and what is old.”  

53 When Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.  

54 Coming to his hometown, he taught in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and mighty works?  

55 Is not this the carpenter’s son? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?  

56 And all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?”  

57 And they took offense at him. But Jesus said, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own house.”  

58 And he did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
