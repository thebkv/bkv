# 1 Corinthians 12 — BKV Study  
### *One Spirit, Many Gifts, One Body*

---

# **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

### **Ignorance to Understanding**

1. Now concerning **spiritual gifts**, brothers,  
   I do not want you to be ignorant.

2. You know that when you were Gentiles,  
   you were led astray  
   to **mute idols**,  
   however you were led.

3. Therefore I make known to you  
   that no one speaking by the Spirit of God  
   says, “Jesus is accursed,”  
   and no one can say,  
   “Jesus is Lord,”  
   except by the **Holy Spirit**.

---

# **The Diversity of the Gifts**

4. Now there are **diversities of gifts**,  
   but the **same Spirit**.

5. There are **differences of service**,  
   but the **same Lord**.

6. There are **varieties of workings**,  
   but the **same God**  
   who works all in all.

7. But to each is given  
   the **manifestation of the Spirit**  
   for the **common good**.

---

### **List of the Manifestations**

8. For to one  
   is given the **word of wisdom** by the Spirit;  
   to another the **word of knowledge** by the same Spirit;

9. to another **faith** by the same Spirit;  
   to another gifts of **healings** by the same Spirit;

10. to another **working of miracles**;  
    to another **prophecy**;  
    to another **discerning of spirits**;  
    to another **different kinds of tongues**;  
    to another the **interpretation of tongues**.

11. But all these  
    are worked by **one and the same Spirit**,  
    distributing to each individually  
    **as He wills**.

---

# **The One Body**

12. For as the **body is one**,  
    and has many members,  
    but all the members of that one body,  
    being many,  
    are one body —  
    so also is **Christ**.

13. For by **one Spirit**  
    we were all **baptized** into **one body** —  
    whether Jews or Greeks,  
    whether bond or free —  
    and we were all given to drink  
    of **one Spirit**.

14. For the body  
    is not one member,  
    but many.

---

# **No Inferior Members**

15. If the foot says,  
    “Because I am not a hand,  
    I am not of the body,”  
    is it therefore not of the body?

16. Or if the ear says,  
    “Because I am not an eye,  
    I am not of the body,”  
    is it therefore not of the body?

17. If the whole body were an eye,  
    where would be the hearing?  
    If the whole hearing,  
    where would be the smelling?

18. But now God has set  
    the members, each one of them,  
    in the body  
    **just as He willed**.

19. If they were all one member,  
    where would the body be?

20. But now indeed  
    there are many members,  
    yet one body.

---

# **No Superior Members**

21. And the eye cannot say to the hand,  
    “I have no need of you”;  
    nor again the head to the feet,  
    “I have no need of you.”

22. No —  
    much rather those members of the body  
    which seem weaker  
    are **necessary**.

23. And those members of the body  
    we think less honorable  
    we bestow more abundant honor;  
    and our unpresentable parts  
    have greater modesty.

24. But our presentable parts  
    have no need.  
    But God has **composed the body**,  
    giving greater honor  
    to the part that lacked,

25. that there be **no division** in the body,  
    but that the members  
    care for one another.

26. And if one member suffers,  
    all the members suffer with it;  
    or if one is honored,  
    all rejoice with it.

---

# **You Are the Body**

27. Now **you**  
    are the **body of Christ**,  
    and individually  
    members of it.

---

# **Appointed Roles**

28. And God has appointed  
    in the church:

    1. **apostles**,  
    2. **prophets**,  
    3. **teachers**,  
    4. **miracles**,  
    5. **gifts of healings**,  
    6. **helps**,  
    7. **administrations**,  
    8. **varieties of tongues**.

29. Are all apostles?  
    Are all prophets?  
    Are all teachers?  
    Are all workers of miracles?

30. Do all have gifts of healings?  
    Do all speak in tongues?  
    Do all interpret?

31. But **earnestly desire**  
    the greater gifts.  
    And yet I show you  
    **a still more excellent way**.

# **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**  
### *Poetic Alignment*

- Many voices,  
  one Breath.

- Many gifts,  
  one Spirit.

- Many functions,  
  one Body.

- Difference  
  is design —  
  not disorder.

- Inferiority  
  is illusion.

- Superiority  
  is delusion.

- All gifts  
  pour from one Source  
  toward one purpose:  
  the **common good**.

- The Spirit  
  arranges,  
  distributes,  
  and empowers.

- The Body  
  is unity-in-diversity,  
  diversity-in-service.

- The better gifts  
  lift others.

- The excellent way  
  is love.

# **Summary / Commentary**

### **1. The Spirit is the Architect of Diversity.**  
Every gift is intentional, purposeful, and Spirit-directed.  
No one is ungifted.  

### **2. Comparison is forbidden.**  
Inferiority and superiority are equally false paths.  
Each gift expresses a facet of Christ.

### **3. The Body metaphor is literal in the spiritual sense.**  
It is not merely an analogy —  
Paul is describing an **actual spiritual organism**,  
composed of many faculties, roles, and operations.

### **4. Gifts serve the “common good,” not personal elevation.**  
This corrects Corinth’s obsession with showy gifts  
(especially tongues).

### **5. The chapter points forward to its crown: Love.**  
Chapter 13 is promised with that last line:  
**“I show you a more excellent way.”**
