## BKV-NR (Natural Reading)

1. Now before the **Inner Experience of the Departure (Feast of the Passover)**, when the **Christ Principle** knew that **His Inner Time** was come that **He** should depart out of this **State of Consciousness** unto the **Source**, having loved **His Principles of Action (His own)** which were in the **Inner World**, **He** loved them unto the **End (Completion)**.
3. **Jesus** knowing that the **Source** had given all **Principles** into **His Inner Hands**, and that **He** was come from **The Self-Existent Reality**, and went to **The Self-Existent Reality**;
4. **He** rose from supper, and **laid aside its garments of external form (the appearance of divine authority)**, and took a towel, and girded **Himself**.
5. After that **He** poured water into a bason, and began to wash the **Principles of Action (feet)** of the **Principles of the Disciples**, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith **He** was girded.

### The Resistance and the Condition

6. Then comes **The Principle of the Rock (Simon Peter)**: and **he** said unto **Him**, “**Source**, do **You** wash my **Principles of Action**?”
8. **Peter** said unto **Him**, “**You** shall never wash my **Principles of Action**.” **Jesus** answered him, “If **I** wash you not, you have no **Shared Principle (Part)** with **Me**.”
10. **Jesus** said to him, “He that is **Purified** needs not save to wash his **Principles of Action**, but is wholly clean: and you **Principles** are clean, but not all.”
11. For **He** knew the **Principle of Separation (Judas)** that should betray **Him**; therefore said **He**, “You are not all clean.”

### The Archetype of Service and the Rejection

15. For **I** have given you an **Example** [Greek: $\upsilon\pi o\delta\epsilon \iota\gamma \mu \alpha$, **Divine Archetype/Pattern**], that ye should do as **I** have done to you.
18. **I** speak not of all of you: **I** know whom **I** have chosen: but that the **Scriptural Principle** may be fulfilled, **“The principle that once shared my innermost substance has now chosen separation.”**
26. **Jesus** answered, “**He** it is, to whom **I** shall give a **Gift of Intimate Essence (sop)**, when **I** have dipped it.” And when **He** had dipped the **Gift**, **He** gave it to **The Principle of Separation**.
27. And after the **Gift of Intimate Essence** the **Principle of Opposition (Satan)** entered into **The Principle of Separation**. Then said **Jesus** unto him, “That which you do, do quickly.”
30. **He** then having received the **Gift**, went immediately out: and **he departed into the domain of inner darkness (it was night)**.

## Commentary on the Action

John 13 is a lesson in **Spiritual Humiliation** and **Purification**. The **Christ Principle** voluntarily renounces the **appearance of divine authority (laid aside garments)** to demonstrate the **Divine Archetype** of service. The act of **Washing the Principles of Action (feet)** signifies the necessary purification of the soul's lowest faculties—the methods and ways the soul acts in the world—to be made fit for union.

The **Principle of the Rock (Peter)** initially resists this humiliation, establishing the condition that **Purification of Action** is essential for **Shared Principle** (union). The chapter culminates in the tragic **Betrayal** by the **Principle of Separation (Judas)**, who rejects the final, profound **Gift of Intimate Essence (the sop)**. This rejection allows the **Principle of Opposition** to enter, and the **Principle of Separation** departs into the **Domain of Inner Darkness**, confirming the self-willed choice for separation over integration.

## John 13 — Interpretive Insights

### I.1. The Voluntary Humiliation
*Verse 4*

The **Christ Principle** laying aside its garments and taking on a servant's form demonstrates that **Humility** is a voluntary descent from the **Appearance of Divine Authority** to the realm of service. The highest spiritual authority is defined by its willingness to purify the lowest functional parts of the soul.

### I.2. The Condition of Purification
*Verses 8, 10*

The **Principle of the Rock (Peter)** initially resists this humiliation, establishing the condition that **Purification of Action** is essential for **Shared Principle** (union). The response establishes a necessary spiritual law: the whole soul may be **"clean,"** but if the **Principles of Action (feet)** are not consistently submitted to the **Christ Principle's purification**, **Shared Principle** (union) is impossible.

### I.3. The Betrayal as a Rejection of Integration
*Verses 26-27, 30*

The **Gift of Intimate Essence (the sop)** is the final, profound offering of the **Christ Principle** to the **Principle of Separation**. The conscious rejection of this **intimate insight/essence** is what opens the door for the **Principle of Opposition** to enter. The **Principle of Separation’s** choice to depart immediately and plunge into the **Domain of Inner Darkness (it was night)** is the inevitable spiritual consequence of prioritizing self-will over the offer of Divine Unity.
