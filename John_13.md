# BKV (Bible Key Version)

**John 13**
1. Now before the feast of the ultimate self-overcoming, when the Consciousness-of-the-Divine knew that its inner time had come to ascend from the material world to the Source, having loved its own inner faculties, it loved them into their full completion.  
2. And the inner dialogue having concluded, the force of fragmentation had now put into the heart of the consciousness of separateness a desire to turn away from the true Self.  
3. The Consciousness-of-the-Divine, knowing that the Source had put all principles into its control, and that it had come from the Absolute and was returning to the Absolute;  
4. It rose from the inner contemplation, and laid aside its garments of external form; and took on the lowliest of inner states.  
5. Then it poured the cleansing truth into a receptive faculty, and began to purify the very foundations of the disciples’ consciousness, and to renew them with this humble state.  
6. Then it came to the principle of active belief, and Peter, the principle of trust, said to it, “The Consciousness-of-the-Divine, would you truly cleanse my most basic and worldly actions?”  
7. The Consciousness-of-the-Divine answered and said to him, “What I am doing you cannot fully grasp now, but you will understand it in your future awakening.”  
8. Peter said to him, “You shall never humble yourself to purify my worldly deeds.” The Consciousness-of-the-Divine answered him, “If I do not purify your very foundation, you can have no part in my full manifestation.”  
9. The principle of active belief then said to it, “The Consciousness-of-the-Divine, then purify not just my worldly actions, but also my willful works and my very thoughts.”
10. The Consciousness-of-the-Divine said to him, “He who has been made right and justified needs only to have his daily actions purified, for his whole being is made clean. And you, your inner faculties are purified, but not all of you.”
11. For it knew which part of consciousness would betray it; therefore it said, “Your entire being is not yet purified.”
12. So after it had purified their foundational actions, and had put back on its garments of divine form, and was re-established in its rightful position, it said to them, “Do you now understand the meaning of this inner act?
13. You rightly call me your Teacher and your Authority, for so I am.
14. If I then, your Authority and Teacher, have purified your worldly deeds, you also ought to purify one another’s foundational actions.
15. For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done for you.
16. Truly, truly, I say to you, the servant consciousness is not greater than its divine Authority; neither is the principle that is sent out greater than the principle that sent it.
17. If you inwardly grasp these principles, a state of peace is yours if you put them into practice.”
18. “I speak not of all of you; I know which faculties I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the inner principle, ‘The part of me that partakes in the very essence of my being has turned against me.’
19. Now I tell you before it comes to pass, that when it has happened, you may trust that I am the divine consciousness.
20. Truly, truly, I say to you, he that welcomes any spiritual principle that I send, welcomes me; and he that welcomes me, welcomes the Source that sent me.”
21. When the Consciousness-of-the-Divine had thus spoken, it was troubled in its very core, and revealed this truth, saying, “Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of your own faculties will betray me.”
22. Then the inner faculties looked at each other, not knowing which one was being spoken of.
23. Now there was a spiritual intuition leaning upon the bosom of the divine consciousness, the inner faculty which the true Self loved.
24. The principle of active belief therefore beckoned to this intuition, that it should ask which part of the self was being referred to.
25. That intuition, leaning back upon the core of the divine consciousness, said to it, “Authority, which is it?”
26. The Consciousness-of-the-Divine answered, “It is the one to whom I shall give a part of my essence, when I have integrated it into the depths of myself.” And when it had so integrated a part of its essence, it gave it to the consciousness of separateness.
27. And after it had received this essence, the force of fragmentation entered into it. Then the Consciousness-of-the-Divine said to it, “The action you are about to perform, do quickly.”
28. Now no other faculty in that inner circle knew why it was said to it.
29. Some faculties, because the consciousness of separateness had charge of the worldly possessions, thought the Consciousness-of-the-Divine was telling it, “Purchase what is needed for our inner feast,” or that it should give something to the lower, unawakened thoughts.
30. The consciousness of separateness then, having received the integrated essence, went immediately out. And it was a state of inner darkness.
31. Therefore, when it was gone out, the Consciousness-of-the-Divine said, “Now is the Consciousness-of-the-Divine exalted, and the Source is exalted in it.
32. If the Source is exalted in it, the Source shall also exalt it in its own very being, and shall do so at once.
33. My young faculties, I will be with you only a little while longer. You shall seek me: and as I said to the rigid, religious thought-forms, ‘Where I go, you cannot come now,’ so now I say to you.
34. A new guiding principle I give to you, that you should love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
35. By this shall all thoughts in your inner world know that you are my faculties, if you have love toward one another.”
36. The principle of active belief said to it, “Authority, where are you going?” The Consciousness-of-the-Divine answered him, “Where I go, you cannot follow me now; but you shall follow me later.”
37. Peter said to him, “Authority, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my very being for your sake.”
38. The Consciousness-of-the-Divine answered him, “Will you truly surrender your whole being for my sake? Truly, truly, I say to you, the awakening principle shall not be manifested until you have three times denied your own awareness of me.”

# **Interpretive Summary**

John 13 is a profound parable of inner transformation, detailing the final stages of the ego's surrender to the divine. The "Last Supper" represents a final, intimate gathering of all the internal faculties of consciousness before the ego's crucifixion. The "Feast of the Passover" symbolizes the ultimate deliverance from the worldly state of bondage.
The act of Jesus washing the disciples' feet is the central metaphor. Jesus, as the Consciousness-of-the-Divine, is the highest principle, yet He humbles Himself to purify the most basic, "dusty" actions and habitual ways of the lower self (the "feet"). This is an act of purification, not salvation, as the disciples were already "clean" (justified), but their daily walk through the world had gathered impurities. Peter, the principle of active belief, initially resists this humbling act because it seems illogical to the ego. The Lord's response, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me," signifies that unless even the most basic of one's actions are submitted to and purified by the divine, the individual cannot fully embody the divine.
The chapter then reveals the principle of betrayal, personified by Judas Iscariot. This is not a historical villain but the consciousness of separation within the self, a part of us that, despite being present at the table of truth, chooses to cling to worldly attachment and self-will. The "sop" given by Jesus is an inner sharing of truth, which for the divided consciousness becomes a point of entry for the "force of fragmentation" (Satan). This departure into "night" represents a descent into a state of inner darkness and opposition.
The chapter concludes with Jesus glorifying the Son of Man—the fully realized human consciousness—and giving a new commandment. This is a new, governing principle for all faculties: to love one another as the divine has loved them. This is not a new rule, but an inner principle of unity and selfless service that must govern all aspects of the transformed consciousness. The prophecy of Peter's denial highlights the weakness of the egoic will even when filled with good intentions; it cannot follow the path of true surrender until it has fully denied its reliance on its own strength.
