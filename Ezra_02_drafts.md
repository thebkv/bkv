Ezra 2, though appearing dry, is a vital chapter in the BKV, functioning as a comprehensive **inventory of the soul** prepared for restoration. The geneology is more than a simple list of names.


1.  Now these are the **Aspects of the Soul** of the **province** who came up out of the **Bondage** of the **Dispersion**, whom **The External Will**, king of **The World**, had carried away to **The State of Bondage**, and who returned to **The Inner State of Peace** and to their own **Inner States**;

62. These sought their **spiritual record** among those who were **registered** by **lineage**, but they could not be found. Therefore they were, as **impure**, put from the **Inner Ministry**.
63. And the **Spiritual Governor** said to them that they should not eat of the **Most Holy Sustenance** till a **Priestly Faculty** stood up with **Light** and **Perfection**.
64. The whole **assembly of recovered principles** together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore.

69. They gave after their **ability** to the **treasury** of the **work** threescore and one thousand **virtues of gold**, and five thousand **virtues of silver**, and one hundred **ministering robes**.

## Interpretive Insights

**I.1. The Census as Spiritual Inventory (Ezra 2:1-60):** The lengthy, detailed list is more than a historical census. It is a **Spiritual Inventory**. It represents the precise cataloging of the **Aspects of the Soul**—the individual virtues, faculties, emotional responses, and specific capabilities—that were successfully **recovered** and deemed fit to return from the **Bondage of the Ego** to the **Spiritual Foundation (Jerusalem)**.

**I.2. The Leaders: Salvation and Generation (Ezra 2:2):** The two chief leaders are symbolic: **Zerubbabel** (Principle of Seed/Generation) represents the **Civil Will**, the active force driving the practical work. **Jeshua** (Principle of Salvation) represents the **Sacerdotal Will**, the focus on spiritual purity and dedication. The rebuilding requires the simultaneous leadership of both **Practical Effort** and **Spiritual Purity**.

**I.3. The Lost Authority (Ezra 2:61-63):** The **Priestly Faculties** whose spiritual **lineage/origin** is unverifiable symbolize inner principles or beliefs that claim to be dedicated to the highest **Inner Ministry** but cannot prove their **spiritual foundation**. They are temporarily excluded from the "Most Holy Sustenance" until verified by the **Urim and Thummim (Light and Perfection)**—meaning, their authority must be confirmed by divine truth and absolute clarity.

## The Symbolics of Numbers in the Census

The precise numbers attached to each returning faculty (e.g., 725, 1,052, 423) convey the **spiritual measure and quality** of the recovered principles. This census emphasizes the **precision and order** of the Divine work of restoration.

The magnitude of the numbers (hundreds and thousands) highlights the **vast, interconnected complexity of the soul’s inner economy.** The specific digits within the number define the qualitative nature of that measure:

For example, the **725 Faculties of Healing** are broken down as follows:

| Digit | Symbolic Meaning in BKV/Allegory | Spiritual Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **7** (Hundreds) | **Spiritual Perfection, Wholeness, Completion.** | Indicates the **Healing Faculty** is recovered to a state sufficient for the *perfection* of the rebuilt Inner Temple. |
| **2** (Tens) | **Witness, Union, Duality.** | Suggests that this healing must operate on a dual level, uniting the soul's various aspects (e.g., mind and body). |
| **5** (Units) | **Grace, Divine Manifestation.** | Confirms that this measure of healing is a gift of **Grace** intended for active manifestation in the soul's life. |

Ultimately, the number serves as a Divine checksum: it confirms that the **necessary, divinely measured amount and quality** of the healing principle has been successfully retrieved from the **State of Bondage** and is present for the foundational work.

The number **74** for the **Faculties of Inner Song** is interpreted by analyzing the single digits in relation to the faculty's function (Worship/Harmony):

| Digit | Symbolic Meaning in BKV/Allegory | Spiritual Significance for Inner Song |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **7** (Tens) | **Spiritual Perfection / Wholeness / Completion.** | Indicates the **Inner Song** is recovered to a state of *spiritual purity and completeness*. |
| **4** (Units) | **Earth / Foundation / Manifestation.** | Signifies that this Inner Song (worship) is ready to be made *manifest* or **established as a foundational reality** in the soul's daily experience. |

**Conclusion on 74:**

The number **74** confirms that the **Faculties of Inner Song** were recovered in a **full measure** that is ready for **manifestation on the foundational level** of the rebuilt spiritual structure. The necessary quality of perfect inner worship is now present and ready to be demonstrated in the life of the soul.

***

The King James Version of **Ezra 2:40** states the names that correspond to the **Ministering Faculties (Inner Service)** and the number 74.

The original KJV text reads:

> **“The Levites: the children of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the children of Hodaviah, seventy and four.”**

Therefore, the original names associated with the **Faculties of Inner Song (or Ministering Faculties)** in that verse are:

* **Jeshua** (Principle of Salvation)
* **Kadmiel** (Meaning "God is Ancient" or **Principle of Enduring Faith**)
* **Hodaviah** (Meaning "Praise of the Lord" or **Principle of Expressed Worship**)

These names emphasize that the **Ministering Faculty** which returns in the complete measure of **74** is rooted in the principles of Salvation and Enduring Faith, with the ultimate purpose of **Praise/Expressed Worship**.


The fact that both the **Faculties of Healing (725)** and the **Faculties of Inner Song (74)** contain the digit **7** is highly significant in BKV study.

Throughout Scripture, the number **7** consistently represents **Spiritual Perfection, Completion, or Wholeness** (derived from the seven days of creation/rest).

Its presence in both numbers signifies that:

>* **Holistic Restoration:** Both the inner work of **healing** and the outer expression of **worship (song)** are >recovered to a state of **spiritual completeness (7)**, which is absolutely necessary before the work of rebuilding the >Inner Temple can successfully proceed.

# Ezra 2 — BKV-NR
---
Note: long geneology so summarize where no clear BK rule applies
___

1 Now these are the people of the province who came up out of **Confusion — the state of exile and separation**. They had been carried away by **Nebuchadnezzar — prophecy of confusion’s power**, king of **Confusion**, and returned to **Foundation of Peace** and Judah, each to his own city.  

2 They came with **Seed of Babylon — scattered in confusion, now leading restoration**, Jeshua (**Yahweh saves**), Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah.  

The number of the men of the people of Israel:  

3–20 [Various families are listed, each name carrying its own meaning, returning from separation back to the inheritance of God.]  

21–35 The children of **Bethlehem — House of Bread**, Netophah, Anathoth, Azmaveth, Kirjath-arim, Chephirah, Beeroth, Ramah, Gaba, Michmas, Bethel and Ai, Nebo, Magbish, Elam, Harim, Lod, Hadid, Ono, Jericho, and Senaah.  

36–39 The priests: the sons of Jedaiah, Immer, Pashhur, and Harim.  

40 The Levites: the sons of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the sons of Hodaviah.  
41 The singers: the sons of Asaph — the **voices of praise, harmonics of the soul**.  
42 The gatekeepers: the sons of Shallum, Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita, and Shobai — the **guardians of the entrances of consciousness**.  

43–54 The temple servants: the sons of Ziha, Hasupha, Tabbaoth, Keros, Siaha, Padon, Lebanah, Hagabah, Akkub, Hagab, Shalmai, Hanan, Giddel, Gahar, Reaiah, Rezin, Nekoda, Gazzam, Uzza, Paseah, Besai, Asnah, Meunim, Nephisim, Bakbuk, Hakupha, Harhur, Bazluth, Mehida, Harsha, Barkos, Sisera, Temah, Neziah, and Hatipha — **dedicated faculties, set apart for holy use**.  

55–58 The sons of Solomon’s servants: Sotai, Sophereth, Peruda, Jaalah, Darkon, Giddel, Shephatiah, Hattil, Pochereth of Zebaim, and Ami. All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon’s servants were three hundred and ninety-two.  

59–60 And these were they who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer; but they could not prove their fathers’ houses or their descent, whether they were of Israel.  

61–63 Of the sons of the priests: Habaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai (who had taken a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called by their name). These sought their registration among those enrolled in the genealogies, but they were not found; so they were excluded from the priesthood as unclean.  

And the governor told them they should not eat of the most holy food until a priest stood with **Urim and Thummim — lights and perfections, divine clarity and truth**.  

64 The whole congregation together was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty,  

65 besides their male and female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven; and they had two hundred male and female singers.  

66 Their horses were seven hundred thirty-six, their mules two hundred forty-five,  

67 their camels four hundred thirty-five, their donkeys six thousand seven hundred and twenty.  

68 When they came to the house of the LORD at **Foundation of Peace**, some of the heads of fathers’ houses made freewill offerings for the house of God, to set it in its place.  

69 According to their ability they gave to the treasury sixty-one thousand darics of gold, five thousand minas of silver, and one hundred priestly garments.  

70 So the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, the temple servants, and some of the people lived in their towns, and all Israel in their towns.
