Genesis 24 extends promise into the next generation through deliberate stewardship. Abraham does not leave union to chance or convenience. The servant operates under instruction, prayer, and discernment. Rebekah responds freely and decisively. The chapter establishes that continuation of promise requires aligned participation across multiple wills, not coercion or coincidence.

## SDR / RFM — Genesis 24  
**When Promise Moves Forward**

For the disciple, Genesis 24 shows how promise continues.

Abraham delegates carefully. The servant prays honestly. Guidance appears through character, not spectacle. Rebekah chooses freely. No force is applied.

The chapter is long because alignment takes time. Every step matters. When promise moves forward rightly, peace accompanies it.

Genesis 24 teaches the disciple that continuity depends on faithfulness across generations. Promise survives when alignment is shared.

The line continues.

Amen.
