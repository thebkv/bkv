# Dossier: Genesis 06  
**Subject: Corruption Exposed and Preservation Commissioned**

---

## BKV Spine

### Spine Summary

Genesis 6 reveals a system-wide breakdown of alignment and the initiation of preservation rather than repair. Corruption is not localized but pervasive, affecting thought, intention, and action. Source does not attempt incremental reform of a destabilized structure. Instead, preservation is commissioned through one aligned steward and a prepared refuge. Judgment appears as containment, not rage, and mercy appears as foresight, not delay. This chapter establishes that when corruption becomes structural, restoration must pass through preservation.

### Disciple Orientation

• Widespread misalignment reshapes intention before action.  
• Reform is ineffective when corruption becomes systemic.  
• Preservation precedes renewal.  
• Alignment is measured by obedience under instruction.

## SDR / RFM — Genesis 06  
**Preservation Before Renewal**

For the disciple, Genesis 6 explains why some systems cannot be repaired from within.

Corruption does not begin with action. It begins with intention. When thought, desire, and imagination are shaped by misalignment, behavior follows naturally. By the time violence fills the earth, the system has already failed.

Source does not debate or negotiate with collapse. Assessment is made. Containment is initiated. Preservation becomes the priority.

Noah is not chosen for perfection, but for responsiveness. He listens. He receives instruction. He builds what he does not yet need, because trust precedes evidence.

The ark is not escape from the world. It is preparation for what the world cannot survive. Preservation is not passive. It requires obedience, precision, and endurance.

Genesis 6 teaches the disciple that renewal often comes only after preservation. When pressure rises, the work is not to save everything, but to protect what can carry life forward.

Alignment builds refuge.

Amen.
