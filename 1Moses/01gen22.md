# Dossier: Genesis 22  
**Subject: Trust Tested Beyond Outcome**

---

## BKV Spine

### Spine Summary

Genesis 22 tests trust after fulfillment. What was received in promise is now placed back into Source hands. The chapter reveals that alignment is not attached to outcome, even when the outcome is beloved. Abraham is not asked to abandon trust, but to release ownership. The test is not about sacrifice itself, but about whether promise is held as gift or possession. The chapter establishes that true trust withholds nothing from Source.

### Disciple Orientation

• Fulfilled promise can become possession.  
• Trust is revealed when outcome is released.  
• Obedience does not require understanding.  
• Provision appears at the point of surrender.

## SDR / RFM — Genesis 22  
**When Trust Lets Go**

For the disciple, Genesis 22 is unsettling.

The promise has arrived. Joy is real. Then the command comes. What you received, return. Not because it was wrong, but because trust must remain free.

Abraham does not argue. He moves. He trusts that Source can give and give again. The test is not about loss, but about allegiance.

Provision appears at the last possible moment. Not early. Not late. Exactly where trust releases control.

Genesis 22 teaches the disciple that true alignment is not proven by what we receive, but by what we are willing to place back in Source hands.

Trust holds nothing back.

Amen.
