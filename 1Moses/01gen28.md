**Subject: Presence Confirmed in Exile**

## BKV Spine

### Spine Summary

Genesis 28 records the first direct encounter between Jacob and Source. Fleeing consequences of deception, Jacob enters exile with no leverage, no security, and no claim. There, presence is revealed without condition. The chapter establishes that promise is not confined to location or merit. Alignment is reaffirmed through encounter, and fear is transformed into orientation. The journey outward becomes the beginning of inward reconfiguration.

### Disciple Orientation

• Presence is not limited by failure or distance.  
• Encounter often occurs during displacement.  
• Promise precedes understanding.  
• Alignment begins with recognition of where Source is.

## SDR / RFM — Genesis 28  
**Finding God on the Run**

For the disciple, Genesis 28 is deeply reassuring.

Jacob is not seeking God. He is running. Yet presence meets him. Not to accuse, but to reaffirm promise. Nothing is withdrawn.

The encounter changes direction. The ground becomes sacred. Fear becomes awareness.

Genesis 28 teaches the disciple that alignment can begin anywhere. Even flight can become foundation.

Presence follows.

Amen.
