# Dossier: Exodus 03
**Subject: The Call That Reveals Identity Before Action**

---

## BKV Spine

### Spine Summary

Exodus 3 marks the moment where hidden formation turns into direct commission. Authority does not appear in power or spectacle, but within ordinary labor. The call is initiated by Presence, not ambition. Identity is clarified before assignment is given. Deliverance will not proceed through human strength, but through alignment with the One who sends. This chapter establishes that true authority flows from revealed identity, not confidence, readiness, or position.

### Disciple Orientation

- Calling emerges during faithful engagement, not waiting.
- Holy ground is recognized by Presence, not location.
- Identity must be revealed before mission can proceed.
- Resistance to calling often hides fear of inadequacy, not humility.

## SDR / RFM — The Name That Sends

For the disciple, Exodus 3 explains why clarity often arrives before confidence.

Moses is not recruited because he is ready. He is called because Presence is ready to act. The bush burns, yet nothing is destroyed. That is how alignment works. Energy without erosion. Authority without domination.

Moses wants credentials. He receives a name instead. Not a title, not an explanation, but **I AM**. Being itself sends him.

The call does not erase fear. It reframes it. Moses will go forward not trusting his voice, his strength, or his past, but the One who stands with him.

Exodus 3 teaches that when Presence speaks, hesitation gives way to obedience, not because the path is clear, but because the Sender is.
