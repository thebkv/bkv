# Dossier: Genesis 36
**Subject: Separation Clarified Through Lineage**

## BKV Spine
Genesis 36 records the lineage of Esau to show legitimate separation. What does not carry the promise still develops structure and power.

## VBV — Minimum Sufficient Role
Esau’s line expands rapidly, forming kings and territories independent of covenant alignment.

## Symbolics
- **Edom** — strength without inheritance
- **Kings before Israel** — power without promise
- **Genealogies** — structural clarification

## SDR / RFM — Not Every Line Carries the Signal
For the disciple, Genesis 36 removes confusion. Prosperity does not equal alignment, and separation is sometimes mercy.
