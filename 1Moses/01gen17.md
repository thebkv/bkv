# Dossier: Genesis 17  
**Subject: Reassertion of Promise and Identity Realignment**

---

## BKV Spine

### Spine Summary

Genesis 17 restores clarity after distortion. Following the impatience and substitution of Genesis 16, Source reappears to restate the promise with precision, expand its scope, and realign identity. Abram is renamed, Sarai is renamed, and covenant markers are formalized. This chapter establishes that promise is not adjusted to human workaround. Instead, identity is reconfigured to match promise. Alignment is reinforced through naming, boundaries, and embodied sign, not through correction by shame.

### Disciple Orientation

• Promise is reaffirmed after misalignment without withdrawal.  
• Identity is reshaped to match calling, not past action.  
• Covenant includes visible markers to anchor trust.  
• Alignment deepens through clarity, not pressure.

## SDR / RFM — Genesis 17  
**When Promise Gets Specific**

For the disciple, Genesis 17 is where promise becomes unavoidable.

Source does not argue with Abram’s detour. He clarifies. He names. He defines. The promise is no longer abstract. It is attached to time, identity, and lineage.

Abram becomes Abraham. Sarai becomes Sarah. The future is spoken into their names. A covenant marker is given, not as punishment, but as reminder. Identity must now live inside promise, not beside it.

Even Ishmael is not rejected. He is acknowledged and blessed within limits. But the promise itself is narrowed. Clarity replaces ambiguity.

Genesis 17 teaches the disciple that alignment deepens when promise is allowed to shape identity. When trust matures, vagueness is replaced by naming.

Promise does not shrink. It sharpens.

Amen.
