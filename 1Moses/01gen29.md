## BKV Spine

### Spine Summary

Genesis 29 introduces prolonged delay into Jacob’s journey. Desire motivates labor, but deception reappears, now directed toward Jacob himself. What he once used, he now experiences. The chapter establishes that alignment matures through patience under misalignment. Promise continues, but growth requires endurance through unjust systems.

### Disciple Orientation

• Desire can sustain effort but not discernment.  
• Deception returns until confronted.  
• Delay forms endurance.  
• Promise advances even under unfair conditions.

## SDR / RFM — Genesis 29  
**Learning Patience the Hard Way**

For the disciple, Genesis 29 is sobering.

Jacob works hard for what he wants, yet deception meets him. The pattern turns back on him. Desire carries him through delay, but clarity comes slowly.

Genesis 29 teaches that endurance under unfairness shapes humility. What is rushed cannot mature.

Promise waits.

Amen.
