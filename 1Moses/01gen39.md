# Dossier: Genesis 39
**Subject: Integrity Under False Accusation**

## BKV Spine
Genesis 39 shows integrity tested in isolation. Advancement pauses, but alignment remains intact.

## VBV — Minimum Sufficient Role
Joseph resists distortion, is falsely accused, and descends again—yet presence remains with him.

## Symbolics
- **House of Potiphar** — delegated authority
- **Garment seized** — integrity tested
- **Prison** — unjust confinement

## SDR / RFM — Presence in the Lowest Place
For the disciple, Genesis 39 teaches that alignment is proven when reward is absent and pressure remains.
