# Dossier: Genesis 03  
**Subject: The Fracture of Trust and the Rise of Self-Definition**

---

## BKV Spine

### Spine Summary

Genesis 3 records the breakdown of aligned authority through mistrust of Source speech. The chapter is not about curiosity or rule-breaking, but about a shift in orientation. Authority moves from dependence to self-definition. What was received is now evaluated independently. The result is fragmentation, concealment, and displacement. Consequence enters not as punishment imposed from outside, but as instability released from within misalignment. This chapter establishes how disorder enters an otherwise ordered system.

### Disciple Orientation

• Misalignment begins with distrust of Source definition.  
• Temptation reframes boundaries as deprivation.  
• Self-definition fractures perception and relationship.  
• Consequence follows orientation, not enforcement.

## SDR / RFM — Genesis 03  
**When Trust Breaks**

For the disciple, Genesis 3 explains why life becomes heavy when trust collapses.

Nothing in this chapter begins with rebellion. It begins with a question about Source intent. The boundary is reframed as restriction. Alignment is presented as loss. Once that shift occurs, judgment moves inward and authority is claimed prematurely.

The moment self-definition replaces trust, perception fractures. Awareness expands without integration. Transparency gives way to hiding. Relationship becomes dangerous instead of grounding.

Source does not respond with surprise. He responds with clarity. Questions are asked, not to gather information, but to invite re-orientation. When responsibility is deflected, consequence unfolds naturally. Labor becomes resistant. Relationship becomes strained. The environment no longer cooperates.

Yet even here, provision remains. Covering is supplied. Life is preserved. Access is restricted not to punish, but to prevent misalignment from becoming permanent.

Genesis 3 teaches the disciple that disorder is not random. It is the outcome of misplaced trust. Restoration will not come through effort alone, but through the return to Source definition.

Alignment is the doorway back.

Amen.
