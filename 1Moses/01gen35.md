# Dossier: Genesis 35
**Subject: Return, Purification, and Stabilization**

## BKV Spine
Genesis 35 marks the return to Bethel where alignment is restored through purification. Old objects, old names, and unstable attachments are buried so identity can stabilize.

## VBV — Minimum Sufficient Role
Jacob is commanded to return, cleanse his household, and re-anchor the system. Authority is reaffirmed, loss occurs, and the lineage is formally stabilized.

## Symbolics
- **Bethel** — place of renewed alignment
- **Foreign gods buried** — removal of competing loyalties
- **New name reaffirmed** — identity stabilized
- **Pillar** — established structure

## SDR / RFM — Returning to the Place of the Promise
For the disciple, Genesis 35 teaches that after crisis and compromise, return is required. Alignment must be consciously re-established for continuity.
