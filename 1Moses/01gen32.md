# Dossier: Genesis 32
**Subject: Confrontation and Renaming**

## BKV Spine
Genesis 32 records the internal crisis where identity can no longer advance under its former name. Alignment is pressed until false strength collapses and a new orientation is received.

## VBV — Minimum Sufficient Role
Jacob prepares for confrontation, divides resources, and encounters resistance not from Esau, but from Source. The struggle ends not in victory by force, but in transformation through surrender.

## Symbolics
- **Night** — the unseen internal arena
- **Wrestling** — sustained inner resistance
- **Limp** — strength replaced by dependence
- **Israel** — identity redefined by alignment

## SDR / RFM — The Night of Renaming
For the disciple, Genesis 32 is where forward motion stops until truth is faced. You do not leave this night unchanged. You leave it renamed.
