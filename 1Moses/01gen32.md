# Dossier: Genesis 32
**Subject: Confrontation and Renaming**

## BKV Spine

### Spine Summary
Genesis 32 records the moment where identity can no longer advance under its former name. Forward movement stalls until unresolved fear, reliance on strategy, and divided strength are exposed. Alignment is pressed not through external threat, but through direct confrontation with Source. Authority does not emerge by winning, but by surrendering false strength and receiving a redefined orientation.

### Disciple Orientation
- Preparation cannot replace transformation.
- Fear reveals where identity is still divided.
- Alignment is not secured by strategy, but by encounter.
- A limp received from truth is stronger than strength preserved by avoidance.

## SDR / RFM — The Night of Renaming
For the disciple, Genesis 32 shows that progress halts until false strength collapses. Alignment advances only after surrender.
