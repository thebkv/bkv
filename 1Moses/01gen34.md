# Dossier: Genesis 34
**Subject: Zeal Without Alignment**

---

## BKV Spine

### Spine Summary

Genesis 34 exposes the danger of zeal detached from alignment. A legitimate violation is met with illegitimate response. Moral outrage replaces discernment, and justice pursued without authorization fractures what promise was meant to preserve. The chapter demonstrates that violence done in the name of righteousness can still stand outside alignment.

### Disciple Orientation

- Outrage is not authority.
- Alignment must govern response, not emotion.
- Covenant signs cannot be weaponized without consequence.
- Protection of identity requires restraint as much as action.

## SDR / RFM — When Zeal Breaks the Vessel

For the disciple, Genesis 34 is a warning chapter.

A real wrong occurs. But the response abandons alignment. Zeal takes control where discernment should lead. The covenant sign becomes a weapon, and violence multiplies beyond the original offense.

Jacob recognizes the danger immediately. The issue is no longer Dinah alone. The entire household is now at risk because action outran authority.

Genesis 34 teaches that righteousness cannot be defended by methods that contradict it. Alignment does not excuse injustice, but it also does not permit destruction in its name.
