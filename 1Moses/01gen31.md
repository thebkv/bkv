## BKV Spine

### Spine Summary

Genesis 31 closes the season of labor and striving. Separation becomes necessary for alignment to continue. Jacob leaves Laban’s system under tension, confrontation, and divine restraint. The chapter establishes that departure from exploitative structures requires decisive action, boundary enforcement, and Source protection. Alignment turns back toward inheritance only after separation is complete.

### Disciple Orientation

• Alignment sometimes requires departure.  
• Separation can be tense but necessary.  
• Boundaries protect future inheritance.  
• Return follows release.

## SDR / RFM — Genesis 31  
**Leaving to Move Forward**

For the disciple, Genesis 31 explains why departure is sometimes required.

Growth has occurred, but alignment cannot mature within exploitative systems. Jacob leaves under tension, but protection surrounds him.

Boundaries are established so return can begin.

Genesis 31 teaches that separation is not failure. It is preparation for inheritance.

Release precedes return.

Amen.
