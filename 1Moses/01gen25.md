**Subject: Transition, Narrowing, and the Passing of Promise**

## BKV Spine

### Spine Summary

Genesis 25 records the transition from Abraham to the next generation and the deliberate narrowing of the promise line. Abraham’s life closes in peace, provision extends to many, yet inheritance is focused. The chapter introduces competing orientations within the same womb, establishing that promise advances through distinction rather than equality. This chapter marks the formal handoff from foundational patriarch to contested heirs.

### Disciple Orientation

• Completion includes release, not retention.  
• Provision can extend broadly while promise narrows.  
• Distinction precedes conflict.  
• Calling is not distributed by birth order.

## SDR / RFM — Genesis 25  
**When Promise Narrows**

For the disciple, Genesis 25 explains why promise often becomes more specific, not more inclusive.

Abraham blesses many, but he entrusts promise to one. Completion requires release. Nothing is clutched.

The next generation begins with tension. Two orientations grow side by side. The struggle is internal before it becomes visible. When choice comes, appetite wins over inheritance.

Genesis 25 teaches the disciple that alignment requires patience for what lasts. What is traded away cheaply is rarely recovered without cost.

Promise passes forward, but not without testing.

Amen.
