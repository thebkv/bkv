# Dossier: Genesis 33
**Subject: Reconciliation Without Erasure**

## BKV Spine
Genesis 33 shows that reconciliation can occur without full resolution. Peace is possible even when scars remain.

## VBV — Minimum Sufficient Role
Jacob meets Esau not as a strategist, but as one altered. The feared confrontation dissolves into mercy, yet paths do not merge.

## Symbolics
- **Bowings** — humility expressed outwardly
- **Gifts** — restitution without bargaining
- **Separate Paths** — peace without fusion

## SDR / RFM — Meeting the Past
For the disciple, Genesis 33 teaches that not every restored relationship resumes its former shape. Peace does not require reversal.
