## SDR / RFM — Peace Without Return

For the disciple, Genesis 33 teaches that reconciliation does not require surrendering discernment.

Jacob meets Esau with humility. The fear that drove strategy collapses the moment love shows up. But the chapter does not end with reunion. It ends with wisdom.

Esau offers closeness. Jacob declines without insult. He does not pretend old patterns are harmless. He chooses peace with distance.

This is reconciliation without regression. Forgiveness happens. Safety is maintained. Alignment does not use peace as an excuse to re-enter what it was delivered from.
