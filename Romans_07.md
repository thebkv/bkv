# Romans 7 — BKV Study (The Wretchedness of the Unassisted Will)
### *The Principle of Internal Conflict and the Failure of the Divided Self*

---

> _“I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.”_ — Romans 7:7 KJV
> _“For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.”_ — Romans 7:19 KJV

*The **Divine Law** is the **perfect mirror** that reveals the soul's **internal fragmentation**. When the unassisted will attempts to execute order, it discovers it is fundamentally divided against itself, creating the necessary **crisis of helplessness** that precedes all true transformation.*

## BKV-NR Context — The Confrontation with the Law

**Romans 7** defines the pivotal stage where consciousness, having received the **Divine Law** (Exodus 20), attempts to fulfill the **Absolute Order** using its own **natural strength**—and fails. This catastrophic failure proves the necessity of a power greater than the self-will. The chapter focuses on the **Inner Split**—the essential conflict between the aspiring **Higher Faculty (the Mind)** and the resistant **Lower Faculty (the Flesh)**. It reveals **Sin** not as a collection of actions, but as a **structural condition** of the human domain.

## **BKV-NR (Natural Reading)**  

### **The Law as the Divine Mirror**

7. Is the **Divine Law** (Decalogue) **Principle of Misdirected Desire (sin)**? Absolutely not! The **Law** is holy; it simply revealed the **Principle of Misdirected Desire** to me, for I would not have known **Craving (Lust)**, except the **Law** had spoken the command, "Thou shalt not crave."

### **The Internal Fragmentation**

14. For we know that the **Law** is **Spiritual Principle**: but the **Unredeemed Self (I)** is **carnal**, **sold** under the **Principle of Misdirected Desire (sin)**.
15. For that which I **execute** I do not **comprehend**: for the **Will of the Source** (good that I would) I do not **manifest**: but the **Opposing Impulse** (evil which I hate), that I execute.
18. For I know that in my **Lower Faculty (flesh)**, there dwells **no operative Divine Good**: for the **Will to Alignment** is present with me; but how to **execute** that **Alignment** I find not.
19. For the **Divine Will (good)** that I would, I **do not execute**: but the **Impulse of Disorder (evil)** which I would not, that I execute.

### **The Wretchedness and the Cry**

21. I find then a **Law (Operating Principle)**, that, when I wish to do the **Divine Will (good)**, the **Impulse of Disorder (evil)** is present with me.
22. For the **Higher Faculty (inward man)** **delights in the Divine Law** (after the law of God):
24. **Wretched is the Unassisted Self (man)** that is separated from the Source! Who shall deliver me from this **body of fragmentation (death)**?

## **Commentary on the Action**

### **1 · Sin as a Structural Condition**
The Law's power is its **revelatory function**. It acts as a **Divine Mirror**, perfectly reflecting the soul's true, **fragmented condition**. **Sin** is not a moral failure but an **operative force**—a spiritual state that **permeates the human experience** and prevents the execution of the truth the mind sees.

### **2 · The Powerlessness of the Law and the Lower Faculty**
The **Law is holy**, but it is a blueprint, not a motor. It reveals the fragmentation but **lacks the power to heal or reconcile** the split. The lower faculty (flesh) finds itself consistently **thwarted** by the principle of misdirected desire. This is a recognition of the **structural inability** of the self to generate sufficient power to overcome the Law of Internal Fragmentation.

### **3 · The Metaphysics of Addiction (Misplaced Causality)**
The true problem of **Misdirected Desire** (addiction/covetousness) is **misplaced causality**. Any worldly addiction—be it for money, power, status, or self-pity (laziness)—is a projection of the mind imagining that an **external, fragmented cause** can solve the **fundamental problem of the soul**. This focus **calls the consciousness away from the Secret Place** (the Source), violating the **Law of Singular Cause**. The resulting struggle is the necessary friction created by serving two contradictory masters.

### **4 · The Split Will and the Cry as a Catalyst**
The conflict between the **Higher Faculty (Mind)** and the **Lower Faculty (Flesh)** is fundamental. The Mind delights in the Law, yet the Flesh is perpetually drawn back to disorder. The cry of the **Wretched Man (v. 24)** is the **necessary catalyst** for spiritual growth. It marks the critical juncture where the consciousness must acknowledge its absolute **helplessness** and turn toward an **external, divine solution**—the **Principle of Divine Resolution** (Romans 8).

## **Core BKV Principle**
> *The **Law** is the **Divine Mirror** that reveals the **structural failure** of the soul. **Sin** is the **Misplacement of Causality** that distracts the will from the Source, ensuring that the **Unassisted Will** remains **fragmented** until it embraces the **Principle of Divine Resolution**.*
