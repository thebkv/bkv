# Exodus 14 — BKV-NR (Tuned)

1 The LORD spoke to **Drawn Out (Moses)**, saying,  

2 “Tell the children of Israel to turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, opposite Baal-zephon. You shall camp by the **sea — the turmoil of the unresolved personality, the chaotic mind**.  

3 For **Pharaoh — the egoic will, oppressive self** will say of the children of Israel, ‘They are wandering in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.’  

4 And I will harden **Pharaoh’s** heart, and he will pursue them, and I will gain glory over **Pharaoh** and all his host, so that the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD.” And they did so.  

5 When the king of **Bondage (Egypt — exile from union with God)** was told that the people had fled, **Pharaoh** and his servants turned against the people and said, “Why have we let Israel go from serving us?”  

6 So he made ready his chariot and took his people with him.  

7 He took six hundred chosen chariots and all the other chariots of **Bondage**, with officers over all of them.  

8 And the LORD hardened the heart of **Pharaoh — the egoic will**, king of **Bondage**, and he pursued the children of Israel, while the children of Israel went out with a high hand.  

9 The Egyptians pursued them, all **Pharaoh’s** horses and chariots and his horsemen and his army, and overtook them encamped by the **sea**, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.  

10 When **Pharaoh** drew near, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they were very afraid. And the children of Israel cried out to the LORD.  

11 They said to **Drawn Out (Moses)**, “Was it because there were no graves in **Bondage** that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us in bringing us out of **Bondage**?  

12 Is not this what we said to you in **Bondage**: ‘Leave us alone that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve in **Bondage** than to die in the wilderness.”  

13 And **Drawn Out (Moses)** said to the people, “Do not fear. Stand firm, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will work for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall never see again.  

14 The LORD will fight for you, and you have only to be still.”  

15 The LORD said to **Drawn Out (Moses)**, “Why do you cry to me? Tell the children of Israel to go forward.  

16 Lift up your staff, stretch out your hand over the **sea** and divide it, that the children of Israel may go through the **sea of turmoil** on dry ground.”  

17 “And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they shall go in after them, and I will gain glory over **Pharaoh** and all his host, his chariots, and his horsemen.  

18 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gained glory over **Pharaoh**, his chariots, and his horsemen.”  

19 Then the angel of God, who went before the host of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them,  

20 coming between the host of Egypt and the host of Israel. And there was the cloud and the darkness to the one side, and light by night to the other side, so that the one did not come near the other all night.  

21 Then **Drawn Out (Moses)** stretched out his hand over the **sea**, and the LORD drove the **sea of turmoil** back by a strong east wind all night and made the **sea** dry land, and the waters were divided.  

22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the **sea of turmoil** on dry ground, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.  

23 The Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the **sea**, all **Pharaoh’s** horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.  

24 In the morning watch, the LORD looked down on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and cloud, and threw the Egyptian army into confusion.  

25 He clogged their chariot wheels so that they drove heavily, and the Egyptians said, “Let us flee from before Israel, for the LORD fights for them against the Egyptians.”  

26 Then the LORD said to **Drawn Out (Moses)**, “Stretch out your hand over the **sea**, that the waters may come back upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.”  

27 So **Drawn Out (Moses)** stretched out his hand over the **sea**, and the **sea of turmoil** returned to its normal course when the morning appeared. And as the Egyptians fled into it, the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the **sea**.  

28 The waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen; of all the host of **Pharaoh** that had followed them into the **sea**, not one of them remained.  

29 But the children of Israel walked on dry ground through the midst of the **sea of turmoil**, the waters being a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.  

30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of **Bondage**, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.  

31 Israel saw the great work that the LORD did against the Egyptians, so the people feared the LORD, and they believed in the LORD and in his servant **Drawn Out (Moses)**.
