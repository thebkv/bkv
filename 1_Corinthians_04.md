# 1 Corinthians 4 — BKV Study    
### *True Servanthood, the Judgment of the Heart, and the Way of Apostolic Life*

---

## **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

1. Let a person regard us in this way:  
   as **servants of Christ** and **stewards of the Mysteries of God**.  
   That is the role — not celebrities, not authorities,  
   but **caretakers of revelation**.

2. And it is required of stewards  
   that a person be found **faithful** —  
   faithful to the message, not to popularity.

3. As for me, it means very little  
   how I am judged by you or by any human court.  
   I do not even fully judge myself.

4. My conscience is clear,  
   yet that alone does not justify me.  
   The One who **examines me is the Lord**.

5. Therefore judge **nothing before the time**,  
   until the Lord comes and **reveals the hidden things** —  
   bringing to light the **motives of the heart**.  
   And then every person shall receive  
   **praise from God**  
   — not from the crowd.

## **The Apostolic Pattern: Living as a Spectacle**

6. I have applied these things to myself and Apollos  
   for your sake,  
   so that in us you may learn  
   **“not to think beyond what is written.”**

7. For who makes you superior?  
   What do you have that you did not receive?  
   And if you received it,  
   why boast as though you created it yourself?

8. Already you think you are full.  
   Already you think you are rich.  
   Without us, you imagine yourselves reigning.  
   I wish you truly were —  
   so that we might reign with you.

9. For it seems that God has displayed us, the apostles,  
   **last of all**,  
   like men **sentenced to death**,  
   made a **spectacle** to the world,  
   to angels,  
   and to men.

10. We are **fools** for Christ’s sake,  
    but you are “wise” in Christ.  
    We are weak,  
    but you are strong.  
    You are honored —  
    we are despised.

11. To this present hour  
    we hunger, thirst, are poorly clothed,  
    buffeted, homeless.

12. We labor with our own hands.  
    When cursed — we bless.  
    When persecuted — we endure.  
    When slandered — we answer gently.

13. We have become like  
    the **filth of the world**,  
    the **offscouring of all things**,  
    to this very moment.

## **A Father’s Warning**

14. I do not write these things to shame you,  
    but to **warn you as my beloved children**.

15. For though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ,  
    you do not have many **fathers**;  
    I became your father in Christ Jesus  
    through the Gospel.

16. Therefore, I urge you:  
    **be imitators of me.**

17. For this cause I am sending Timothy to you,  
    who will remind you of my ways in Christ —  
    just as I teach in every assembly everywhere.

## **The Kingdom in Power**

18. Some among you have become **puffed up**,  
    imagining that I will not come.

19. But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills,  
    and I will know —  
    not the speech of those who are puffed up,  
    but the **power**.

20. For the **Kingdom of God**  
    is not in **word**,  
    but in **power**.

21. What do you prefer?  
    Shall I come with a **rod**,  
    or with **love and a spirit of gentleness**?

# **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**  
### *A Poetic Alignment with the Text*

- Servants,  
  not sovereigns.  
  Stewards,  
  not performers.  
  Bearers of the Mysteries,  
  not owners of them.

- The lower mind judges early;  
  the higher mind waits for the Light  
  that reveals the motives of the heart.

- The world crowns the loud.  
  God crowns the faithful.

- Apostles walk the edge of the world  
  like condemned men —  
  but when cursed, they bless.  
  When struck, they endure.  
  When slandered, they remain gentle.  
  This is the power the world cannot see.

- Many teachers,  
  few fathers.  
  Many words,  
  little power.

- The Kingdom moves not by talk  
  but by flame —  
  not by gestures,  
  but by Presence.

# **Summary / Commentary**

1 Corinthians 4 is Paul at his most **fatherly**, most **piercing**, and most **vulnerable**.

It exposes three truths:

### **1. True ministry is stewardship, not status.**  
Apostles and teachers are **caretakers** of revelation —  
not celebrities, not personalities, not rulers.

### **2. Apostolic life follows the Christ-pattern of weakness and paradox.**  
Paul presents the apostles as a living picture of the upside-down Kingdom:

- despised yet gentle,  
- condemned yet faithful,  
- cursed yet blessing,  
- fools yet entrusted with the mysteries.

This is **the cruciform life** made visible.

### **3. The Kingdom is recognized not by words, but by power.**  
Paul bluntly contrasts empty talk with **actual spiritual force**.  
The Kingdom is detected not in argument,  
but in **presence**,  
in **endurance**,  
in **transformation**,  
in **gentleness under pressure**.

This chapter is a mirror held up to any spiritual community —  
including ours —  
asking a single question:

**Are we performing the faith,  
or living it with power?**
