# 1 Corinthians 4 — BKV Study (The Principle of Inner Accountability)
### *Faithfulness, Judgment, and the Measure of True Power*

---

> _“Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.”_ — 1 Corinthians 4:1–2 KJV
> _“For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?”_ — 1 Corinthians 4:7 KJV

*Having established the **Singular Foundation** (Ch. 1), the means of **Revelation** (Ch. 2), and the **Architecture of Growth** (Ch. 3), Paul now reveals the **Law of Accountability**—the inward reckoning by which every faculty must render account before the **Source**. The faculties that govern the **Inner Church** are not owners but **Stewards** of the **Hidden Divine Purpose (Mysteries)**. True authority is measured by **Faithfulness**, not by self-assessment. Only the **Source** may render **Judgment**, exposing the **Secret Intentions** of the heart and dissolving the arrogance of the **Lower Faculty**.*

## BKV-NR Context — The Standard of Stewardship

**1 Corinthians 4** addresses the root cause of the previous chapters’ fragmentation: **Self-Glory and Misplaced Judgment**. Paul asserts that the governing faculties (apostles/ministers) are simply **Stewards**—administrators of the **Source’s** revealed truth, not its originators. Their only standard is **Faithfulness** (accountability), which can be judged by the **Source** alone. The chapter dismantles the self-congratulating nature of the **Lower Faculty**, reminding the **Inner Church** that the **Kingdom of the Source** is proven by **Power** (Divine Operation), not by **Word** (intellectual assertion).

## BKV-NR (Natural Reading)  

### **The Role of the Steward**

1. Let a man so account of us, as of the **Ministers of the Principle of Divine Humanity**, and **Stewards** of the **Hidden Divine Purpose (Mysteries)** of the Source.
2. Moreover, it is required in **Stewards**, that a man be found **Faithful** (accountable).
3. But with me it is a very small thing that I should be **Judged** by you, or by **Man’s Day** (temporal judgment): yea, I judge not mine own self.
4. For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not hereby **Justified**: but he that **Judges** me is the **Source**.
5. Therefore **Judge nothing before the proper time**, until the **Principle of Divine Humanity** comes, who will bring to light the **Hidden Things of Obscurity**, and will make manifest the **Secret Intentions** of the heart: and then shall every man have praise of the **Source**.

### **The Nullification of Arrogance**

7. For who makes you to **Differ** from another? And what do you have that you did not **Receive**? Now if you did **Receive** it, why do you **Glory**, as if you had not **Received** it?
10. We are **Unlearned** for the **Principle of Divine Humanity’s** sake, but you are **Wise** in the Principle of Divine Humanity; we are **Weak**, but you are **Strong**; you are **Honorable**, but we are held in contempt.
20. For the **Kingdom of the Source** is not in **Word** (rhetoric), but in **Power** (Divine Operation).

### **The Authority of the Spirit**

21. What will you? Shall I come unto you with a **Rod** (Discipline), or in **Love**, and in the **Spirit of Meekness (Creative Impulse)**?

## **Commentary on the Action**

### **1 · Accountability by Faithfulness (vv 1–5)**
The governing faculty’s role is **Stewardship**, emphasizing service and accountability rather than ownership. **Faithfulness** is the only standard. **Judgment** (v. 3) belongs solely to the **Source**, who alone perceives the **Hidden Things** and **Secret Intentions** of the inner being.
Self-judgment and external judgment (Man’s Day) are unreliable, for they operate within partial perception.
→ *See also* **Luke 12:42–44**, where Christ describes the faithful and wise steward set over the household.

### **2 · The Folly of Self-Glory (v 7)**
This verse serves as a central *spiritual instrument* for dissolving pride. All gifts—whether of intellect, insight, or power—are **Received**, not self-generated.
The moment the **Lower Faculty** claims ownership of the **Creative Impulse’s** operation, fragmentation begins.
→ *See also* **John 3:27** — “A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.”

### **3 · Power over Rhetoric (v 20)**
The **Kingdom of the Source** (the Inner Domain) is proven by **Power**, the operative non-human force that brings **Divine Resolution**, not by **Word**, which represents intellectual analysis or eloquence.
True spirituality manifests transformation, not argument.
→ *See also* **Acts 1:8**, where power (not persuasion) marks the coming of the Spirit.

### **4 · The Authority of Meekness (v 21)**
Paul contrasts two modes of authority: **Discipline (Rod)**—the corrective force for the fragmented will—and **Love in the Spirit of Meekness**, the natural authority of the aligned soul.
True authority flows not through coercion but through yieldedness to the **Creative Impulse**, whose meekness is strength in equilibrium.
→ *See also* **Matthew 11:29**, where Christ identifies meekness as the foundation of rest and spiritual power.

## **Core BKV Principle**

> *Power belongs to the Spirit, not to speech; authority is proved by **Faithfulness**, not by pride. Thus the **Lower Faculty** is silenced, and the **Steward** stands justified only in the **Light of the Eternal Source**.*
