# 1 Corinthians 8 — BKV Study  
### *Knowledge, Conscience, Love, and the Law of Edification*

---

# **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

### **Knowledge Without Love Becomes Pride**

1. Now concerning food offered to idols —  
   we know that we all “have knowledge.”  
   But **knowledge puffs up**,  
   while **love builds up**.

2. If anyone thinks he **knows** anything,  
   he does not yet know  
   as he ought to know.

3. But if anyone **loves God**,  
   he is **known by Him**.

### **Idols and the One God**

4. As concerning food offered to idols:  
   we know that an **idol is nothing** in the world,  
   and that there is **no God but one**.

5. For though there be so-called gods  
   in heaven or on earth  
   — as indeed there are many that are called gods and lords —

6. Yet for us there is **One God**, the Father,  
   from whom are all things,  
   and we for Him;  
   and **one Lord, Jesus Christ**,  
   through whom are all things,  
   and we through Him.

### **The Weaker Conscience**

7. But not all possess this knowledge.  
   Some, through long habit,  
   still regard the idol as something real;  
   and when they eat,  
   their conscience — being **weak** —  
   is **defiled**.

8. But food does not commend us to God.  
   We are no worse for not eating,  
   and no better if we do.

### **Freedom Governed by Love**

9. But take care  
   lest this **freedom of yours**  
   becomes a **stumbling block**  
   to those who are weak.

10. For if someone sees you,  
    who have knowledge,  
    sitting at the table in an idol’s temple,  
    will not his weak conscience  
    be encouraged  
    to eat things sacrificed to idols?

11. And so through your knowledge,  
    the **weak brother perishes**,  
    the one for whom Christ died.

12. And when you sin against the brothers  
    by wounding their conscience —  
    you sin against Christ.

13. Therefore,  
    if meat causes my brother to stumble,  
    I will eat no flesh at all,  
    lest I cause him to stumble.

### *Poetic Alignment*

- Knowledge alone  
  inflates the self.  

- Love alone  
  strengthens the soul.  

- An idol is nothing —  
  the power is in the mind  
  that believes it.

- Freedom is real,  
  but freedom without love  
  destroys the weak.

- Your conscience  
  is the delicate instrument  
  that registers spiritual alignment.

- The strong must slow down  
  for the sake of the weak;  

- for the one who wounds  
  a brother’s conscience  
  wounds Christ Himself.

- If my freedom harms another,  
  my freedom is misused.

- Better to abstain  
  than to injure  
  the inner life  
  of one for whom  
  Christ died.

# **Summary / Commentary**

1 Corinthians 8 is the **inner blueprint** for how the spiritually mature must care for the spiritually sensitive. It reveals:

### **1. Knowledge can inflate, but love constructs.**  
Knowledge without humility breeds superiority.  
Love turns knowledge into wisdom.

### **2. Idols have zero intrinsic power.**  
Their only force is the meaning the mind projects onto them.  
This is central to the BKV.

### **3. The conscience is a spiritual instrument.**  
It can be strong or weak, clear or confused.  
It must be protected.

### **4. The strong must limit their freedom for the sake of the weak.**  
This is one of Paul’s most profound moral principles.

### **5. Hurting a brother’s conscience is treated as harming Christ Himself.**  
This is not metaphorical in Paul’s thought —  
it is the mystical reality of the Body.

### **6. The principle:  
If my liberty wounds another, my liberty is misused.**

This chapter is the hinge point for 1 Corinthians 8–10,  
leading into the deep symbolic themes of **idols, temples, conscience, sacrifice, and participation in spiritual realities**.
