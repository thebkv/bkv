# Isaiah 2 ‚Äî BKV Study (The Principle of Elevated Consciousness)

## *From Purified Vision to True Ascent*

‚∏ª

>‚ÄúAnd it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord‚Äôs house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.‚Äù ‚Äî Isaiah 2:2 KJV
>‚ÄúThe lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.‚Äù ‚Äî Isaiah 2:11 KJV

When the soul is cleansed of false worship, the Mountain of the Source arises within ‚Äî an elevated state where Divine Law becomes the organizing principle of consciousness. Yet every form of pride that seeks to climb by its own strength must fall, for only the Source can be truly exalted.

BKV-NR Context ‚Äî The Ascent and the Humbling

Isaiah 2 opens with a radiant vision of Integrated Consciousness ‚Äî the Mountain of the Source, established above all lesser hills of opinion and desire. All ‚Äúnations‚Äù (faculties and motives) flow upward, seeking the Law of the Source. But the same chapter quickly warns that the soul, once illuminated, must guard against renewed pride: the very light that reveals Truth also exposes the remnants of self-exaltation. The Day of the Source is therefore both revelation and correction ‚Äî the collapse of false elevation so that the true Mountain may stand alone.

BKV-NR (Natural Reading)

The Vision of Ascent (vv 2‚Äì5)

2 . In the latter state of consciousness, the Mountain of the Source‚Äôs House (the Elevated Consciousness) is established at the summit of all being, exalted above the hills of transient understanding; and all the faculties flow toward it.
3 . They say, ‚ÄúCome, let us go up to the Mountain of the Source, to the House of the Ultimate Reality (Inner Sanctuary); for there we shall receive Instruction, and walk in the Paths of Divine Law.‚Äù
4 . For out of Zion (Elevated Consciousness) shall proceed the Law, and the Word of the Source from the Inner City. He shall judge between faculties and reconcile inner powers; and the forces of conflict shall be reshaped into instruments of service. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation within, neither shall they learn inner war any more.

The Descent into Idolatry (vv 6‚Äì9)

6 . But the House of Jacob (Core Self) has been filled with external influences and self-sufficiency; they seek the wisdom of foreign lands (the worldly mind) and multiply silver, gold, and the chariots of self-assertion ‚Äî their own instruments of domination.
8 . Their land is full of Idols ‚Äî the concepts they fashion with their own hands ‚Äî and they bow to the work of their own imagination.
9 . Therefore the mean man bows down, and the great man humbles himself to his own creation. The Source cannot overlook this inversion.

The Day of Revelation (vv 10‚Äì17)

10 . Enter into the Rock of Truth and humble yourself in the dust, for the Presence of the Source is arising within.
11 . The lofty looks of man are brought low, and the pride of the ego is bowed down; and the Source alone is exalted in that Day.
13 . For the Day of the Source shall be upon all that is high and lifted up ‚Äî upon the cedars of Lebanon (the towering intellect), upon the oaks of Bashan (the stubborn will), upon the high mountains of self-importance, upon every tower of self-achievement, upon every wall of self-defense ‚Äî all shall be brought low, that the One Foundation may stand.

The Casting Away of Idols (vv 18‚Äì22)

18 . And the idols He shall utterly abolish.
20 . In that illumined day the soul casts away its idols of silver and gold ‚Äî the beliefs it once forged for security ‚Äî and throws them to the moles and bats (the hidden instincts and fears), fleeing to the clefts of the rocks from the glory of the Source.
22 . Cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of?

Commentary on the Action

1 ¬∑ The Vision of Ascent (vv 2‚Äì5)

This vision portrays the restored order of the soul after the purification of Isaiah 1. The Mountain of the Source is the center of Divine Governance within consciousness; its ‚Äúnations‚Äù are the faculties once at war now moving in harmony toward Law and Light. It is not geographical but architectural ‚Äî the spirit‚Äôs new alignment around a single Axis of Truth.

2 ¬∑ The Descent into Idolatry (vv 6‚Äì9)

Even after awakening, the lower faculties seek external splendor and intellectual superiority. This section echoes Isaiah 1‚Äôs condemnation of ritual but extends it to mental idolatry ‚Äî the worship of ideas, methods, and success as substitutes for Presence. The result is self-subjugation to the work of one‚Äôs own hands.

3 ¬∑ The Day of Revelation (vv 10‚Äì17)

The Day of the Source is the moment of illumination that topples the false heights. Each symbol of greatness ‚Äî cedar, oak, mountain, tower ‚Äî represents a faculty that must be brought into humility before Spirit. The collapse of pride is not annihilation but equalization ‚Äî the leveling of terrain so that the One Mountain may rise unobstructed.

4 ¬∑ The Casting Away of Idols (vv 18‚Äì22)

Here the soul rejects its final attachments. The idols of silver and gold are mental constructs once believed sacred; now they are recognized as shadows. The flight ‚Äúto the rocks‚Äù marks the return to the Original Foundation ‚Äî Truth unadorned by illusion.

Core BKV Principle

When the inner mountain rises and Divine Law governs the faculties, the soul enters the state of Elevated Consciousness. But every false height of ego must be brought low, for only the Source is truly exalted in that day. üß≠

Minor Commentary ‚Äî Continuity with Isaiah 1

Isaiah 1 and 2 form a single movement. Chapter 1 exposes the inner city in ruin and purifies it through fire; chapter 2 shows that city rebuilt as a mountain of light. The burning away of ego becomes the rising of Spirit. Where Isaiah 1 cried for cleansing, Isaiah 2 reveals the pattern of Divine Order that emerges after the cleansing ‚Äî the soul ascending from ashes to architecture, from ritual to reality.
