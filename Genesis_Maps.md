# **GENESIS MAPS — BIBLE KEY VERSION (BKV)**
### *The Geography of the Soul in the First Book of Scripture*

---

## **I. Overview: The Inner Terrain of Genesis**

Genesis unfolds across a series of physical locations that mirror **inner states of consciousness**.  
Every movement in the book — from Eden to Egypt — is a diagram of the soul’s journey:

- **Eden** — Harmony, Innocence, Conscious Awareness of God  
- **Wilderness East of Eden** — Disorientation, Loss of Center  
- **Shinar/Babel** — Confusion through Self-Exaltation  
- **Ur** — Cultural Conditioning  
- **Haran** — Delay, In-Between Spaces  
- **Canaan** — The Promised State of Alignment  
- **Egypt** — Constriction, Fear-Based Security  
- **Hebron** — Union / Fellowship / Inner Joining  
- **Bethel** — Awakening, Encounter, “House of God”  
- **Shechem** — Shouldering Responsibility  
- **Dothan** — Split Perception, the Fork in the Road  

These locations repeat throughout Scripture because they represent **recurring states of the inner life**. Genesis makes them visible for the first time.
