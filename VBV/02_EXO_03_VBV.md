# Exodus 3 — VBV

* [Exodus 3 — Presence Revealed, Authority Commissioned](VBV/02_EXO/02_EXO_03_VBV.md)

## Summary
Divine presence interrupts ordinary labor, establishes sacred attention, reveals identity, and commissions delegated authority for liberation. Resistance is acknowledged, but the call proceeds on the basis of presence rather than capability.
