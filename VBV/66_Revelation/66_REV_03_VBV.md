# **BKV–NR (Natural Reading)**

## **1 · To the State of Sardis — The State of **Awakened Authenticity**  
**vv. 1–6**

1. To the **Messenger** of the **State of Sardis** write:  
“These are the words of the One who holds the **Seven Guiding Principles** and possesses the **Fullness of the Spirit**:  
I know your **works**—that you have a **name** suggesting life, yet are **inwardly dormant**.

2. Become **watchful**, and strengthen the **remaining sparks of life** within you.  
For I have not found your **inner works** complete before the **Absolute Source**.

3. Remember therefore what you have **received** and **heard**; hold fast the **Inner Word**, and let it awaken you.  
If you do not awaken, I will come upon you in an hour your consciousness cannot foresee.

4. Yet you possess a few **faithful faculties** in **Sardis** that have not stained their garments.  
These shall walk with Me in **clarity**, for they align with the Truth.

5. The one who overcomes shall be clothed in **White Raiment**—the state of **Transparent Purity**—and I will not erase its **True Identity** from the **Book of Life**, but will affirm that identity before the **Source** and the **Higher Faculties**.

6. Let the **faculty that hears** attend to what the **Spirit of Truth** speaks to the **states of consciousness**.”

## **2 · To the State of Philadelphia — The State of **Enduring Devotion**  
**vv. 7–13**

7. “These are the words of the One who is **Holy**, who is **True**, who holds the **Key of David**—the authority that opens the **Inner Door** none can shut, and shuts what none can open:

8. I know your **works**. Behold, I have set before you an **Open Door**, and no opposing force can shut it.  
For though you have **little outward strength**, you have **kept My Word**, and you have **not denied My Name**.

9. I will cause those of the **False Assembly**—those who claim alignment yet operate in deception—to recognize that I have **loved you**.

10. Because you have kept the **Word of My Endurance**, I will keep you during the hour of **inner testing** that shall come upon all consciousness to prove what is genuine.

11. Hold fast what you possess, that no force distort your **Crown of Devotion**.

12. The one who overcomes, I will make a **Pillar** in the **Inner Sanctuary of the Source**; such a one shall no longer depart from stability.  
And I will inscribe upon this faculty the **Name of the Source**, the **Name of the New Inner City**—the **New Jerusalem** descending from the **Heavenly Faculty**—and its own **Renewed Identity**.

13. Let the **faculty that hears** attend to what the **Spirit of Truth** says to the **states of consciousness**.”

## **3 · To the State of Laodicea — The State of **Lukewarm Self-Reliance**  
**vv. 14–22**

14. “These are the words of the **Faithful and True Witness**, the **Origin of the Inner Creation**:

15. I know your **works**—that you are neither **hot** nor **cold**; you are **lukewarm**, suspended between wholeheartedness and refusal.

16. Because you are **lukewarm**, and neither **hot** nor **cold**, your state is unstable and self-defeating.

17. For you say, ‘I am rich, increased with goods, and have need of nothing,’  
yet you do not perceive that you are **wretched**, **miserable**, **poor**, **blind**, and **naked**—depleted of inner perception.

18. I counsel you to obtain from Me **Gold Tried in the Fire**—the **Purified Essence** of the true self—that you may become authentically rich;  
and **White Garments** to clothe the **inner nakedness**;  
and **Eye-Salve** to restore the **spiritual sight** of your inner perception.

19. As many as I love, I **reprove** and **refine**; therefore be **zealous** and **turn inward**.

20. Behold, I stand at the **Inner Door** and call;  
if any faculty hears My voice and opens the door, I will enter into **communion** with it, and it with Me.

21. To the one who overcomes, I will grant to sit with Me in **Shared Dominion**, just as I overcame and sat with the **Source** in **Inner Authority**.

22. Let the **faculty that hears** give attention to what the **Spirit of Truth** says to the **states of consciousness**.”

# Commentary on the Three States

## **1 · Sardis — Awakening into Authenticity**  
Sardis dramatizes the tension between **reputation** and **reality**.  
The soul appears active but is inwardly dormant.  
The cure is **awakening**, **remembering**, and **restoring the inner spark**.  
White raiment symbolizes **unmasked transparency**.

---

## **2 · Philadelphia — Devotion That Holds Fast**  
Philadelphia embodies **faithful affection in weakness**.  
The **Open Door** symbolizes a divine opportunity no force can close.  
Here devotion produces **stability**, and stability becomes **identity**, inscribed with the **Name of the Source**, the **New Inner City**, and one’s **Renewed Identity**.

---

## **3 · Laodicea — The Refining of Self-Reliance**  
Laodicea represents the crisis of **lukewarm self-sufficiency**.  
The soul must confront its illusion of independence.  
The remedy is threefold:

- **Gold Tried in Fire** — purified essence  
- **White Garments** — restoration of innocence  
- **Eye-Salve** — spiritual perception  

This state ends with the deepest invitation of all:  
to open the **Inner Door** to communion with the Divine Self.

# Continuity Commentary  
Revelation 1 unveils the **True Consciousness**.  
Revelation 2 refines the first four **states of consciousness**.  
Revelation 3 completes the sevenfold **inner calibration**, confronting:

- **Sardis** — inauthentic existence  
- **Philadelphia** — faithful devotion  
- **Laodicea** — self-reliant lukewarmness  

Only when these final states are brought into alignment does the soul hear the **Heavenly Voice** of Revelation 4:

> “A door was opened in heaven…”

This is the ascent of the **Spiritual Intuition** into the Higher Faculty, where the universal laws of synthesis unfold.
