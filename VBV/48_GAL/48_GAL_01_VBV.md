# Galatians 1 — VBV

* [Galatians 1 — Authority and Orientation Established](VBV/48_GAL/48_GAL_01_VBV.md)

SUMMARY

Galatians 1 establishes the authority and origin of the gospel before addressing any dispute. Paul asserts that the message he proclaims comes from divine initiative rather than human mediation, and he confronts deviation as a loss of alignment rather than an acceptable variation.

| KJV | VBV |
|-----|-----|
| Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ. | Paul’s authority is grounded in divine calling rather than human appointment. |
| And all the brethren which are with me. | The message is shared within communal witness. |
| Grace be to you and peace. | Favor and restored order are extended. |
| Who gave himself for our sins. | Deliverance is grounded in self-giving action. |
| That he might deliver us from this present evil world. | Rescue involves re-orientation from a corrupted order. |
| I marvel that ye are so soon removed. | Departure from alignment is expressed with urgency. |
| Unto another gospel. | An altered orientation is identified. |
| Which is not another. | The deviation is exposed as distortion, not alternative. |
| But there be some that trouble you. | External influence introduces confusion. |
| Though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel. | No authority supersedes the received message. |
| Let him be accursed. | Deviation is decisively rejected. |
| Do I now persuade men, or God? | Approval from people is dismissed as a measure. |
| If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. | Alignment excludes dependence on human validation. |
| The gospel which was preached of me is not after man. | The message is not derived from human reasoning. |
| For I neither received it of man. | Its source is not instructional transmission. |
| But by the revelation of Jesus Christ. | The message was disclosed through divine initiative. |
| Ye have heard of my conversation in time past. | Paul’s former orientation is acknowledged. |
| And profited in the Jews' religion above many. | Prior advancement did not equate to alignment. |
| But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb. | Calling precedes personal achievement. |
| To reveal his Son in me. | Transformation occurs through inner disclosure. |
| I conferred not with flesh and blood. | Authority was not sought from human sources. |
| Neither went I up to Jerusalem. | Institutional validation was not primary. |
| But I went into Arabia. | Withdrawal preceded public confirmation. |
| Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem. | Limited contact followed established calling. |
| And I saw none of the other apostles. | Independence of origin is maintained. |
| Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. | The work expanded beyond initial centers. |
| And they glorified God in me. | Recognition followed alignment, not the reverse. |
