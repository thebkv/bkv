|-----|-----|
| Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault. | Failure is acknowledged without condemnation. |
| Restore such an one in the spirit of meekness. | Restoration is pursued with gentleness. |
| Bear ye one another's burdens. | Responsibility is shared within community. |
| For every man shall bear his own burden. | Personal accountability remains intact. |
| Be not deceived; God is not mocked. | Orientation inevitably produces outcome. |
| For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. | Life follows the direction it is given. |
| He that soweth to the flesh. | Self-directed living leads to decay. |
| But he that soweth to the Spirit. | Spirit-directed living yields life. |
| Let us not be weary in well doing. | Perseverance is required over time. |
| In due season we shall reap. | Outcome unfolds with patience. |
| As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men. | Freedom expresses itself through generosity. |
| Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you. | The closing is marked with emphasis. |
| As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh. | External display is exposed as false security. |
| God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross. | Identity is grounded in self-giving love. |
| For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing. | External markers carry no governing power. |
| But a new creature. | Inner renewal defines identity. |
| From henceforth let no man trouble me. | Alignment is settled. |
| The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. | Grace remains the sustaining presence. |
