BACKGROUND — GALATIANS

AUTHOR  
The letter was written by Paul the apostle. He writes personally and forcefully, grounding his authority not in institutional appointment but in direct calling and revelation.

DATE  
Galatians was likely written around AD 48–55, during Paul’s early missionary period, shortly after the establishment of the Galatian churches and before later, more systematic letters such as Romans.

AUDIENCE  
The recipients were assemblies in the region of Galatia, composed largely of Gentile believers who had received the gospel through Paul’s preaching and experienced life in the Spirit apart from Jewish law.

LOCATION  
Paul was not writing from Galatia itself, but from elsewhere in his missionary travels (possibly Antioch or another early mission center), responding to reports that the communities were being unsettled.

CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT  
After Paul’s departure, teachers influenced by Jewish tradition urged Gentile believers to adopt elements of the Mosaic law—particularly circumcision—as necessary for full inclusion. This pressure reframed the gospel as something that must be completed through external observance rather than lived through trust and the Spirit.

Galatians addresses this crisis directly. The letter defends the divine origin of the gospel, rejects law-based identity, and insists that freedom, sonship, and new life come through union with Christ rather than conformity to religious systems.
