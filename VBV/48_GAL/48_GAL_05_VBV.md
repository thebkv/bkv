# Galatians 5 — VBV

* [Galatians 5 — Freedom Sustained by the Spirit](VBV/48_GAL/48_GAL_05_VBV.md)

SUMMARY

Galatians 5 establishes freedom as the governing condition of life in Christ while warning against both legal regression and self-indulgence. True freedom is sustained by alignment with the Spirit, producing discernible fruit that law itself could never generate.

| KJV | VBV |
|-----|-----|
| Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free. | Freedom is declared as the condition to be maintained. |
| Be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. | Regression into control is warned against. |
| If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. | Law-dependence nullifies freedom. |
| Ye are fallen from grace. | Alignment is lost through misplaced reliance. |
| For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness. | Right standing is lived through inward trust. |
| Faith which worketh by love. | Alignment expresses itself through love. |
| Ye did run well; who did hinder you? | Misalignment entered through influence. |
| A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. | Distortion spreads quietly. |
| Ye have been called unto liberty. | Freedom is the calling. |
| Only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh. | Freedom is not license for self-indulgence. |
| By love serve one another. | Freedom expresses itself relationally. |
| Walk in the Spirit. | Life is directed by inward alignment. |
| For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit. | Two orientations oppose one another. |
| If ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. | Spirit-led life transcends external control. |
| Now the works of the flesh are manifest. | Misalignment produces visible outcomes. |
| But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace. | Alignment produces coherent life. |
| Against such there is no law. | Law is unnecessary where life is ordered inwardly. |
| They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh. | Old orientation has been relinquished. |
| If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. | Life and conduct must align. |
| Let us not be desirous of vain glory. | Rivalry and self-comparison are rejected. |
