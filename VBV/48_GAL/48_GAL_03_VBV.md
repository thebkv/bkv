# Galatians 3 — VBV

* [Galatians 3 — Life Begun by Spirit, Not Completed by Law](VBV/48_GAL/48_GAL_03_VBV.md)

SUMMARY

Galatians 3 confronts the regression that occurs when revelation is replaced by effort. Paul argues that life initiated by trust in God’s promise cannot be completed through law. The law is shown to be temporary and preparatory, while shared identity in Christ establishes unity beyond distinction.

| O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you? | A loss of clarity is confronted directly. |
| Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh? | Spirit-initiated life is wrongly replaced by effort. |
| Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law? | The origin of life is questioned. |
| Even as Abraham believed God. | Trust is identified as the original alignment. |
| Know ye therefore that they which are of faith. | Alignment is defined by trust, not lineage. |
| For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse. | Dependence on law results in failure. |
| Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law. | Release from condemnation is declared. |
| That the blessing of Abraham might come. | Promise extends beyond original boundaries. |
| Brethren, I speak after the manner of men. | An appeal to coherence is made. |
| The law, which was four hundred and thirty years after. | Law is placed after promise. |
| Wherefore then serveth the law? | The law’s purpose is questioned. |
| It was added because of transgressions. | Law restrains disorder temporarily. |
| The law was our schoolmaster. | Law functions as a guardian. |
| But after that faith is come. | The guardian’s role concludes. |
| For ye are all the children of God by faith. | Identity is grounded in trust. |
| For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ. | Union defines belonging. |
| There is neither Jew nor Greek. | Distinctions lose governing power. |
| For ye are all one in Christ Jesus. | Unified identity is established. |
| And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed. | Promise is inherited through union. |
