# Galatians 2 — VBV

* [Galatians 2 — Alignment Tested Under Pressure](VBV/48_GAL/48_GAL_02_VBV.md)

SUMMARY

Galatians 2 tests whether the gospel remains intact when confronted by authority, tradition, and fear. Paul affirms that truth is not altered by reputation and confronts behavior that contradicts revealed alignment. Justification is clarified as arising from trust rather than law, and life is shown to flow from union rather than performance.

| Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem. | After time passed, Paul returned to engage leadership. |
| And communicated unto them that gospel which I preach. | The message was presented for coherence, not approval. |
| But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. | No external requirement was imposed. |
| And that because of false brethren unawares brought in. | Pressure arose from misaligned influence. |
| To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour. | Alignment was not compromised. |
| But of these who seemed to be somewhat. | Reputation was acknowledged but not determinative. |
| God accepteth no man's person. | Standing does not alter truth. |
| They added nothing to me. | The message required no supplementation. |
| When they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me. | Mission was differentiated without division. |
| And when James, Cephas, and John perceived the grace given unto me. | Recognition followed revealed alignment. |
| They gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship. | Unity was affirmed without control. |
| But when Peter was come to Antioch. | A public test of consistency occurred. |
| I withstood him to the face. | Misalignment was confronted directly. |
| For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles. | Freedom had been practiced openly. |
| But when they were come, he withdrew. | Fear altered behavior. |
| And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him. | Misalignment spread through influence. |
| But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel. | Action was measured against truth, not intent. |
| I said unto Peter before them all. | Correction was made openly to restore alignment. |
| Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law. | Right standing is not achieved through performance. |
| But by the faith of Jesus Christ. | Trust in Christ establishes alignment. |
| For by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. | Law cannot produce life. |
| For I through the law am dead to the law. | Dependence on law was relinquished. |
| I am crucified with Christ. | Identity shifted through union. |
| Nevertheless I live; yet not I. | Life is no longer self-generated. |
| But Christ liveth in me. | Life flows from indwelling presence. |
| I do not frustrate the grace of God. | Grace is not nullified by law. |
| For if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. | Law-based righteousness empties grace of meaning. |
