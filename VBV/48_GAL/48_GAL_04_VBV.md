# Galatians 4 — VBV

* [Galatians 4 — From Guardianship to Sonship](VBV/48_GAL/48_GAL_04_VBV.md)

SUMMARY

Galatians 4 contrasts immaturity under control with mature freedom through sonship. Paul argues that returning to systems of supervision after receiving inheritance is a regression into bondage. True maturity lives from relationship and promise rather than regulation.

| KJV | VBV |
|-----|-----|
| Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child. | Immaturity experiences restriction despite inheritance. |
| But is under tutors and governors. | Control governs until maturity arrives. |
| Even so we, when we were children. | The condition applied broadly. |
| But when the fulness of the time was come. | A decisive moment of transition arrived. |
| God sent forth his Son. | Sonship was initiated by divine action. |
| To redeem them that were under the law. | Release from control was accomplished. |
| And because ye are sons. | Identity is affirmed. |
| God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts. | Sonship is lived inwardly. |
| Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son. | Status shifts from bondage to relationship. |
| Howbeit then, when ye knew not God. | Former bondage is recalled. |
| But now, after that ye have known God. | Awareness has changed. |
| How turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements? | Regression into control is questioned. |
| Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. | Regulation replaces relationship. |
| I am afraid of you. | Concern is expressed, not domination. |
| I beseech you, be as I am. | Appeal is made on relational grounds. |
| Ye would have plucked out your own eyes. | Former affection is remembered. |
| Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? | Truth is distinguished from hostility. |
| Which things are an allegory. | Two modes are contrasted. |
| The one from the mount Sinai. | Bondage is associated with control. |
| But Jerusalem which is above is free. | Freedom is associated with promise. |
| Now we, brethren, as Isaac was. | Identity is aligned with inheritance. |
| So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman. | Bondage is renounced. |
| But of the free. | Freedom is affirmed. |
