# 1 Kings 01 — VBV

* [1 Kings 01 — Authority Unsettled, Authority Named](VBV/11_1KI/11_1KI_01_VBV.md)

## Summary

As rightful authority grows quiet, false authority moves in. Order returns only when succession is clearly declared and publicly set in place.
Don't fight your problems, instead practice the presence to put God in the driver's seat.

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. | Rightful authority remains, but its strength is fading; the center no longer warms the system. |
| Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin… | Those around authority try to preserve comfort instead of addressing succession. |
| And Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king… | Nearness to authority does not grant authority. |
| Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king… | When authority is silent, self-assertion fills the space. |
| And he prepared him chariots and horsemen… | Display is used to imitate legitimacy. |
| And his father had not displeased him at any time… | Uncorrected desire grows bold. |
| And he conferred with Joab… and with Abiathar… | Misaligned ambition gathers familiar support. |
| But Zadok… and Nathan… were not with Adonijah. | Those aligned with true authority do not follow premature claims. |
| And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen… and called all his brethren… | Celebration is staged to make authority seem settled. |
| But Nathan the prophet… and Solomon, he called not. | Legitimate succession is intentionally left out. |
| Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba… | Discernment steps in when order is threatened. |
| Hast thou not heard that Adonijah… doth reign? | Disorder advances quietly when silence is mistaken for consent. |
| Now therefore come, let me give thee counsel… | Alignment requires action, not assumption. |
| And Bathsheba went in unto the king… | Appeal returns to the true source of authority. |
| And the king sware… Solomon thy son shall reign after me. | Rightful authority is named aloud. |
| And Zadok… anointed Solomon king… | Authority is transferred through recognized order. |
| And all the people came up after him… | Order stabilizes when alignment becomes public. |
| And Adonijah feared… and caught hold on the horns of the altar. | False authority collapses when legitimacy is established. |
| And king Solomon said… If he will shew himself a worthy man… | Authority is preserved through restraint, not retaliation. |
| So Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar… | Disorder is resolved without destruction once order is restored. |
