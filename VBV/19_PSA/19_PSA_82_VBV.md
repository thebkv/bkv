# Psalm 82 — VBV
* [Psalm 82 — Authority Judged and Reclaimed](VBV/19_PSA/19_PSA_82_VBV.md)

## Summary
This psalm presents a moment where delegated authority is summoned, examined, and judged. Those entrusted with judgment are found to have failed in their role. Their authority is exposed as conditional and mortal, and final sovereignty is reclaimed by the One who alone judges rightly.

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods. | Authority is convened, and judgment begins within the governing order itself. |
| How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. | The failure of judgment is confronted: authority has favored power over justice. |
| Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy. | The standard of authority is restated: protection of the vulnerable defines rightful judgment. |
| Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked. | Authority is measured by action, not position; judgment must intervene against oppression. |
| They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course. | Blind authority destabilizes the entire order; misalignment spreads system-wide. |
| I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. | Delegated authority is acknowledged as granted, not inherent. |
| But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. | Authority without alignment is stripped; delegated power proves mortal and collapses. |
| Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations. | Final judgment is reclaimed by true sovereignty, restoring rightful order to all domains. |
