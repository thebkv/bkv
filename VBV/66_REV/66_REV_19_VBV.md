# Revelation 19 VBV - Authority Restored (MSR)

## Praise, Union, and the Manifestation of Rightful Authority (19:1-21)

**(1-5)** After the collapse, a unified response arises in **higher awareness**, declaring **alignment restored**; wholeness, coherence, value, and authority return to **Source Awareness**.

**(6-9)** Let coherence and joy arise, for **union with truth** has arrived, and **receptive identity** is now aligned and prepared.

**(10)** Do not misplace reverence; align with **Source**, for **experienced truth** is what animates perception and vision.

**(11-16)** Higher awareness opens, revealing **mobilized righteous authority**; the governing presence is **reliable and integrated**, and enacted truth proceeds through **spoken clarity**.

**(17-18)** Let all distorted structures be fully consumed by truth, as false **governing systems** are dissolved under **ultimate authority**.

**(19-21)** Distorted authority and its allied systems attempt resistance, but **imitation power** collapses when confronted by integrated truth.
