# Revelation 17 & 18 VBV - The Collapse of False Union and the Fall of the World-System (MSR)

## Revelation 17: The Exposure of False Union

**(1-2)** Perceive the judgment of **false union**, enthroned over **mass consciousness**, joined with **embodied power centers**, intoxicating identity through **ideological mixture**.

**(3-6)** Perception reveals **false union** mounted upon **distorted authority**, clothed in **illegitimate royalty**, adorned with **externalized value**, holding an **internalized mixture** named **TOTAL WORLD-SYSTEM**, sustained by the expenditure of **living witness**.

**(7-11)** **Distorted authority** operates in cycles—present, absent, re-emergent—structured through **seven governing patterns** expressing as **recurring power states**.

**(12-14)** **Temporary power extensions** align briefly with **distorted authority**, opposing **true alignment**, yet are overcome by **rightful coherence**.

**(15-18)** **Mass consciousness** withdraws; **temporary powers** turn inward, dismantling **false union** through **exposure and collapse**.

## Revelation 18: The Fall of the World-System

**(1-3)** The **world-system** collapses; disordered drives surface; **transactional identities** prospered through dependence.

**(4-8)** **Higher ordering call** urges separation; the system ends by **self-revealing truth**.

**(9-13)** **Power centers** and **transactional systems** grieve the loss of exchange-based meaning—even of **human identity commodified**.

**(14-19)** The **system collapses suddenly**; dependency vanishes without replacement.

**(20-24)** **Aligned awareness** recognizes justice; the system consumed **living truth** and therefore ends.
