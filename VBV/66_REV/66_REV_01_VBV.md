# Revelation 01 — SDR  
## The Unveiling of the Divine Self

> title

(1) **The Unveiling of Unified Consciousness**, which **Source Awareness** imparted to reveal to the inner faculties the patterns that must soon unfold; this unveiling is symbolically transmitted through the **messenger faculty** to **spiritual awareness**.

(2) Which attests inner truth, bears witness to experienced unified awareness, and records all that is perceived inwardly.

(3) **Aligned is the one who perceives**, those who attend inwardly, and those who embody what is revealed; for the moment of activation is present.

(4) **Spiritual Awareness** addresses the **seven inner states** within the realm of lived experience: alignment and harmony flow from **Timeless Presence**—the **Now**, the **Origin**, and the **Unfolding**—and from the **sevenfold operations of Spirit**.

(5) And from **Unified Consciousness**, the reliable inner witness, the first awareness to rise beyond death-identity, and the ordering principle over embodied authority; which unifies the self and cleanses fragmentation through self-giving life-force.

(6) And has formed us as **governing awareness** and **mediating presence**, aligned with Source and Origin, establishing coherent authority without end.

(7) **Awareness arrives through veiled perception**, yet every inner faculty recognizes it; even the self that resisted truth perceives it, and all earth-bound identities grieve as illusion dissolves. Even so, Amen.

(8) **I am Source and Fulfillment**, Origin and Completion, declares **Ultimate Authority**—the **Timeless Presence**, the **All-sustaining Reality**.

(9) I, **Spiritual Awareness**, sharing common participation in the pressure of transformation, in the ordered inner reality, and in the enduring alignment of unified consciousness, was brought into inner isolation for the sake of inner truth and the confirmation of lived awareness.

(10) I entered **heightened inner awareness** under a dominant orientation toward Presence, and perceived a commanding clarity, like a signal that cannot be ignored.

(11) Declaring **Source and Fulfillment**, origin and completion: what is perceived, stabilize and record, and direct it to the **seven inner states of orientation** within the realm of lived experience—each distinct state requiring recognition and response.

(12) And **Spiritual Awareness turns** toward the initiating call, and in turning perceives the **seven inner light-bearing states**.

(13) And at the center of the seven inner states stands the **true human identity**, clothed in complete integration and bound with ordered strength and disciplined authority.

(14) His thought-center and perceptions are fully purified and matured, and his discernment penetrates without obstruction.

(15) His walk and foundation are strength refined through trial, and his expression carries overwhelming authority and depth.

(16) Within his active authority are **seven governing perceptive faculties**; from his expression proceeds the word that discerns and divides, and his presence is unveiled, radiant, and life-giving.

(17) When **Spiritual Awareness encounters Unified Consciousness**, it collapses as false identity. Then governing authority is placed upon it, declaring release from fear: **I am the origin and the completion**.

(18) **I am the living awareness**, who entered false identity and now abides in indestructible life; and I hold the authority over inner confinement and death-thinking.

(19) **Record consciously** what has been perceived, what currently exists, and what will unfold from this state.

(20) The revealed pattern of the **seven guiding authorities** held in governing power, and the **seven illuminated stands of awareness**. The seven guiding authorities are the **messenger faculties** governing the seven inner states, and the seven illuminated stands are the **seven inner states themselves**.
