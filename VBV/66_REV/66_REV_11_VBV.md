# Revelation 11 VBV - The Measured Inner Temple and the Two Witnesses (MSR)

## Discernment, Testimony, and the Final Signal (11:1-19)

### Measurement and Exclusion (11:1-2)

**(1-2)** Discernment is granted through a **standard of alignment**, delivered by the **messenger faculty**, instructing awareness to **assess the inner dwelling of Presence**, the **point of inner exchange**, and the **active orientations of devotion**. But the **externalized identity** is excluded from assessment, left to **unintegrated influence**, where sacred awareness is **compressed for a defined cycle**.

### The Paired Testifying Functions (11:3-6)

**(3-6)** Authority is granted to the **paired testifying functions**, which **articulate truth** across a complete cycle in **humble expression**. These operate as **living spiritual supply** and **light-bearing awareness**, standing before **foundational reality**. Resistance to them triggers **self-consuming consequence**, and they exercise **regulatory authority over inner conditions**.

### Suppression and Restoration (11:7-13)

**(7-10)** When the **testifying functions complete their role**, a **disruptive force from unconscious depths** opposes them, silencing expression. Their **inactive states** are displayed within the **dominant world-system identity**, which **celebrates the suppression of truth**.

**(11-13)** After a defined pause, **restorative divine vitality** reanimates the silenced functions, lifting them into a **higher order of consciousness**, producing **systemic disruption and reorientation**.

### The Seventh Trumpet and Unified Rule (11:14-19)

**(14-19)** The **final integrative signal** sounds, transferring **governing authority** from fragmented systems to **Unified Rule**. The **inner dwelling of Presence is unveiled**, revealing the **core covenantal structure**, accompanied by **full-spectrum perceptual phenomena**.
