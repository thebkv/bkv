# Revelation 14 VBV - Firstfruits, True Allegiance, and the Inner Harvest (MSR)

## The Firstfruits: True Allegiance (14:1-5)

**(1)** I perceived **pure obedient consciousness** established in **inner alignment**, accompanied by **fully integrated inner order**, bearing the **source-identity imprint** in awareness.

**(2-3)** Awareness receives **overarching truth**, resonant as **deep coherence** and **decisive authority**; a **lived resonance** emerges that only **integrated stability** can embody.

**(4-5)** These remain **undivided**, preserving **singular allegiance**; they are the **initial mature yield**, expressing **undistorted truthfulness**.

## The Threefold Message of Consequence (14:6-13)

**(6-7)** A **messenger function** announces the **timeless alignment principle**: re-orient attention, recognize **true authority**, and restore **right valuation**.

**(8)** **World-system logic** collapses, having intoxicated consciousness with **misaligned incentive** and **divided allegiance**.

**(9-11)** If awareness aligns with **distorted authority**, adopts its **imitated identity**, and operates by its **allegiance**, it inherits the **natural consequence of misalignment**.

**(12)** Stability emerges through **enduring alignment**, maintaining **ordered obedience** and **trust in unified consciousness**.

**(13)** Aligned are those who **release former identities** into **true authority**, entering **integration and rest**.

## The Inner Harvest and Separation (14:14-20)

**(14-16)** **Mature human awareness** applies **decisive discernment** as lived states reach **readiness for separation**.

**(17-20)** Accumulated patterns are **compressed**, revealing **true essence** as consequences overflow the **field of experience**.
