# Revelation 04 VBV — The Throne-Room Shift

Attention is reoriented from scattered perception to a unified governing center.

## The Orientation to Governing Presence (4:1–11)

**(1)** After this, awareness perceives an **access point** opening into **higher awareness**; the summoning voice—clear and commanding—calls upward, saying, “Reorient here, and perception will be shown what follows.”

**(2)** Awareness is immediately re-centered inwardly; a **governing center** is established in **higher awareness**, and **unified presence** occupies it.

**(3)** The governing presence manifests as **clarity** and **value**, encircled by **continuity of promise**, radiant with **living coherence**.

**(4)** Surrounding the center are **mature governing faculties**, seated in ordered stability, clothed in **clarity of intention**, bearing **delegated authority**.

**(5)** From the center flow **insight, resonance, and expression**; before it operate the **sevenfold active principles of Spirit**.

**(6)** Before the center lies a **stilled emotional field**, perfectly transparent; surrounding it operate **four primary modes of perception**, saturated with **awareness**.

**(7)** The perceptual modes present as **strength**, **service**, **relational awareness**, and **transcendent vision**.

**(8)** Each perceptual mode is **fully mobile**, saturated with **awareness**, ceaselessly affirming **wholeness**, the **timeless sustaining Presence**.

**(9–10)** As perception attributes **coherence, value, and gratitude** to the center, the **governing faculties** relinquish their **delegated authority** back to source.

**(11)** You alone are worthy of **coherence, value, and sustaining force**, for all structures arise from and remain oriented toward you.
