* [Haggai 1 — Deferred Alignment and Restored Momentum](VBV/37_HAG/37_HAG_01_VBV.md)

SUMMARY

Haggai 1 confronts delayed alignment and its tangible effects. The people have not rejected God, but postponed priority, resulting in frustration and lack. When attention is corrected and action follows, momentum is restored and provision begins to realign.

| KJV | VBV |
|-----|-----|
| Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come. | A rationale for delay is stated openly. |
| Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses? | Comfort has advanced while alignment has stalled. |
| Consider your ways. | Attention is directed inward. |
| Ye have sown much, and bring in little. | Effort produces diminished return. |
| Ye eat, but ye have not enough. | Satisfaction is absent despite provision. |
| He that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes. | Accumulation fails to hold. |
| Go up to the mountain, and build the house. | Action is redirected toward priority. |
| Why? saith the LORD of hosts. | The cause is made explicit. |
| Because of mine house that is waste. | Neglect is identified as central. |
| Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew. | The environment reflects misalignment. |
| And I called for a drought. | Constraint mirrors priority disorder. |
| Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech. | Leadership responds first. |
| And the LORD stirred up the spirit of all the remnant. | Willingness is reactivated. |
| And they came and did work in the house of the LORD. | Alignment produces immediate movement. |
| I am with you, saith the LORD. | Presence accompanies obedience. |

# The Cost of Not Yet - Haggai

A Disciple Reading of Haggai

⸻

The book of the prophet Haggai was written around 520 BC,
during the early years after the return from exile.

The people were back in Jerusalem.
The exile was over.
The crisis had passed.

And that matters.

Because Haggai is not written to people in rebellion.
It’s written to people who believe, who returned, who began well.

The foundation of the Temple had already been laid.
The intention was real.
The work had started.

But it stalled.

Life filled in around it.

There were economic pressures.
There was opposition.
And the new work didn’t look like the old glory.

So attention shifted.

Not away from God entirely —
just away from finishing what mattered most.

⸻

That helps explain why Haggai is such a different prophetic book.

There are no visions here.
No symbols to decode.
No distant future scenes.

Haggai speaks plainly.

Because the issue isn’t mystery.
The issue is order.

He speaks to people who can see 
and still aren’t moving.

His words are dated to specific days,
aimed at specific choices,
and spoken directly to leaders and workers.

This is instruction for people who already know the truth,
but have put off doing anything about it.

⸻

So who is Haggai written to?

Historically, he speaks to returned exiles rebuilding Jerusalem.

Practically, he’s written to any disciple whose life looks like this:

Things are mostly stable.
Faith is intact.
The worst season is over.

But something central has been left unfinished.

Not because you don’t care.
Because the timing never quite feels right.

⸻

Before we go further, it helps to say this out loud:

Every page of Scripture carries a word for the believer
and a word for the disciple.

They are the same word.
They simply meet us in different places.

The believer hears reassurance —
that God is faithful, patient, and near.

The disciple hears responsibility —
not guilt, it’s a call to get right with God,
Clean up your life,
and practice His presence.

A believer may be learning to trust.
A disciple has decided to practice.

Both belong here.

⸻

Haggai’s own name points to the heart of the book.

His name comes from a Hebrew root meaning appointed time —
a set moment.

And his entire message presses on one sentence:

“The time is not yet.”

That sentence sounds reasonable.
Careful.
Even wise.

And Haggai shows what it costs.

⸻

Chapter One — The Cost of “Not Yet”

Chapter one opens with the Lord saying:

“This people say, The time is not come.”

Now the disciple right away here's what that is saying to him.

It’s a reasoned delay.
A sensible postponement.
I've reason this out I have other things to worry about right now before I get to that.
I’ve got a business to run. I gotta look after my health, whatever it is.

Then comes the question:

“Is it time for you to dwell in your finished houses,
while this house lies waste?”

Comfort has moved ahead.
Getting right with God has been put off.

And from there, the results speak for themselves.

They work hard.
They bring in little.
They eat, but aren’t satisfied.
They earn, but can’t quite hold onto it.

This isn’t punishment.
It’s consequence.

When life is out of order, effort turns heavy.

The instruction is simple:

“Consider your ways.”

Look at the sequence.
Look at what keeps getting postponed.

Then the environment responds.

Drought.
Resistance.
Lack of support.

Not because God has left —
but because disorder doesn’t sustain flow.

Leadership moves first.
The people follow.

And the moment obedience resumes,
movement returns.

God’s presence accompanies the work immediately —
not because the building is finished,
but because things are back in the right order.

⸻

Chapter Two — When the Work Feels Small

Chapter two comes quickly.

The work has restarted.
But it looks unimpressive.

Nothing like the old days.

This is a familiar moment.

Comparison.

The Lord names it plainly:

“Who among you remembers the former glory?
How does this look to you now?”

The disciple feels this pressure right away.

Starting again rarely feels glorious.

The instruction isn’t speed.
It’s steadiness.

“Be strong.
And work.
For I am with you.”

Presence — not appearance — becomes the measure.

Encouragement doesn’t come first here.
The work comes first.

Then comes the promise:

“The glory of this latter house will be greater than the former.”

Not immediately.
Not visibly.

But surely.

And the blessing is fixed to a moment:

“From this day forward, I will bless you.”

Not when the project is finished.
Not when it looks impressive.

From the day the heart turns back
and stays with the work.

⸻

What the Listener Can Do Next

So what does this mean for you, practically?

Not in theory.
Not spiritually abstract.

Three simple movements.

First — name what you’ve been putting off.
The thing you know matters,
but keeps getting a later date.

Second — put it back in its rightful place.
Even if it feels small.
Even if it looks unimpressive.

Third — stay with it.
Don’t wait for motivation.
Don’t wait for reassurance.
Don’t wait for it to feel dramatic.

Getting right with God usually feels quiet at first.
What returns first isn’t excitement —
it’s steadiness.

⸻

Haggai speaks to people whose faith hasn’t failed,
but whose priorities have drifted.

And his message is simple.

Now is the time.

Do the work that puts life back in order.

Stay with the work.

And let things begin to hold together again.

That is the call.

Amen.
