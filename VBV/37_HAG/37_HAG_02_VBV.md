SUMMARY

Haggai 2 addresses discouragement that arises after obedience has begun. Though present results appear small compared to the past, the people are called to remain aligned, grounded in divine presence and future promise. The chapter sustains momentum by shifting attention from visible scale to unfolding fulfillment.

| KJV | VBV |
|-----|-----|
| Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? | Comparison with the past is acknowledged. |
| And how do ye see it now? | Present perception is examined. |
| Is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing? | Discouragement is named honestly. |
| Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel. | Strength is called for despite appearance. |
| And be strong, all ye people of the land. | Collective resolve is reinforced. |
| For I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts. | Presence, not scale, is reaffirmed. |
| According to the word that I covenanted with you. | Continuity of promise is maintained. |
| Yet once, it is a little while. | Timeframe is reframed. |
| And I will shake all nations. | Larger reordering is declared. |
| And the desire of all nations shall come. | Future convergence is anticipated. |
| The silver is mine, and the gold is mine. | Material limitation is relativized. |
| The glory of this latter house shall be greater. | Fulfillment is deferred but assured. |
| And in this place will I give peace. | Stability is promised as outcome. |
| If one that is unclean touch any of these. | The principle of transfer is examined. |
| So is this people, and so is this nation. | Past disorder is acknowledged. |
| From this day will I bless you. | Change of direction is marked. |
| In the four and twentieth day of the month. | The moment of realignment is fixed. |
| Speak to Zerubbabel, saying. | Leadership is addressed directly. |
| I will shake the heavens and the earth. | Authority beyond the present order is asserted. |
| And I will make thee as a signet. | Leadership is secured by promise. |
| For I have chosen thee. | Alignment is sealed by divine choosing. |
