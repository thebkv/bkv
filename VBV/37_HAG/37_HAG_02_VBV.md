| KJV | VBV |
|-----|-----|
| Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? | Comparison with the past is acknowledged. |
| And how do ye see it now? | Present perception is examined. |
| Is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing? | Discouragement is named honestly. |
| Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel. | Strength is called for despite appearance. |
| And be strong, all ye people of the land. | Collective resolve is reinforced. |
| And work: for I am with you. | Presence, not scale, is reaffirmed. |
| According to the word that I covenanted with you. | Continuity of promise is maintained. |
| Yet once, it is a little while. | Timeframe is reframed. |
| And I will shake all nations. | Larger reordering is declared. |
| And the desire of all nations shall come. | Future convergence is anticipated. |
| The silver is mine, and the gold is mine. | Material limitation is relativized. |
| The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former. | Fulfillment is deferred but assured. |
| And in this place will I give peace. | Stability is promised as outcome. |
| If one that is unclean touch any of these. | The principle of transfer is examined. |
| So is this people, and so is this nation before me. | Past disorder is acknowledged. |
| From this day will I bless you. | Change of direction is marked. |
| In the four and twentieth day of the month. | The moment of realignment is fixed. |
| Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah. | Leadership is addressed directly. |
| I will shake the heavens and the earth. | Authority beyond the present order is asserted. |
| And I will make thee as a signet. | Leadership is secured by promise. |
| For I have chosen thee. | Alignment is sealed by divine choosing. |
