# Ecclesiastes 2 — VBV

* [Ecclesiastes 2 — Tested Without Remainder](VBV/21_ECC/21_ECC_02_VBV.md)

SUMMARY

Ecclesiastes 2 records a deliberate experiment in meaning through pleasure, accomplishment, and wisdom. Each pursuit is taken to its fullest extent and examined honestly. The chapter shows that while enjoyment and skill exist, none of them can secure permanence, control outcomes, or prevent the erosion of satisfaction by time and mortality.

| I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity. | I said to myself, I will test pleasure and enjoyment, and found that this too failed to hold. |
| I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? | I examined laughter and joy and found them unable to sustain meaning. |
| I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men. | I explored indulgence while remaining aware, to see what benefit it truly offered within life. |
| I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: | I undertook great projects, building and cultivating on a large scale. |
| I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits: | I created ordered spaces of growth and abundance. |
| I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees: | I controlled resources to sustain what I had made. |
| I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle. | I acquired people, property, and extensive wealth. |
| I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces. | I accumulated wealth and the privileges of status. |
| I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men. | I surrounded myself with art, music, and pleasure. |
| So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. | I surpassed those before me in achievement, while retaining awareness. |
| And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy. | I denied myself nothing that promised satisfaction. |
| Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit. | I examined everything I had accomplished and found instability and inward strain in it all. |
| For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun? | What remains from all this effort and inward striving? |
| For his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart taketh not rest in the night. | Even rest is interrupted, and concern continues without pause. |
| There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. | Enjoyment exists in receiving simple good within one’s work. |
| This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God. | This capacity for enjoyment is received, not produced. |
| For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I? | Apart from this gift, satisfaction cannot be forced. |
| For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy. | Wisdom and joy are given, not secured by effort. |
| But to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. | Accumulation without orientation leads only to transfer and loss. |
| This also is vanity and vexation of spirit. | This too fails to hold and produces inward strain. |
