# Ecclesiastes 1 — VBV

* [Ecclesiastes 1 — Cycles Without Arrival](VBV/21_ECC/21_ECC_01_VBV.md)

SUMMARY

Ecclesiastes 1 establishes the interior condition of a consciousness that observes life clearly while seeking permanence within a world governed by repetition. The chapter records cycles that continue without resolution, the failure of memory and novelty to secure meaning, and the burden that increased understanding brings when no stable point of orientation has yet been found.

| The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. | The words of one who speaks from reflection, a king whose authority has turned inward. |
| Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity. | Instability upon instability. Everything fails to hold. |
| What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? | What lasting gain comes from effort expended within this passing order? |
| One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. | One generation departs and another arrives, while the earth remains unchanged. |
| The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. | The sun rises and sets, returning again to where it began. |
| The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits. | The wind turns south, then north, circling endlessly along the same paths. |
| All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. | Rivers flow to the sea, yet the sea is never filled; they return again to their source. |
| All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. | Everything produces weariness. Seeing does not satisfy the eye, nor hearing the ear. |
| The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. | What has been will be again. What has been done will be done again. Nothing truly new appears. |
| Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. | Even what is called new has existed before, though it is no longer remembered. |
| There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after. | Memory does not preserve the past, nor will it secure the future. |
| I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. | I speak as one who once ruled, now observing rather than commanding. |
| And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. | I applied my mind to understand all that is done under heaven and found the task itself heavy for humanity to bear. |
| I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit. | I observed all activity within this world and saw instability and inward strain in it all. |
| That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. | What is bent cannot be straightened, and what is absent cannot be supplied. |
| I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. | I reflected within myself, knowing I had gained greater understanding than those before me. |
| And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. | I turned my attention to wisdom and to folly alike and recognized both as inward strain. |
| For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow. | Increased understanding multiplies grief, and deeper knowledge increases sorrow. |
