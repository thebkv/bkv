# Ruth 02 — VBV

* [Ruth 2 — Provision Found Under Favor](VBV/08_RUT/08_RUT_02_VBV.md)

## Summary
Humble work enters a field of favor, protection is quietly arranged, and provision begins to accumulate—not by grasping, but by steady, lawful seeking.

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| (1) And Naomi had a kinsman… Boaz… | A lawful redeemer-option exists within the community—strength with standing. |
| (2) And Ruth… Let me now go to the field… | Loyal attachment asks permission to labor humbly for provision. |
| (3) And she went… and her hap was… Boaz… | What seems like chance is guided into the right field. |
| (4) And, behold, Boaz came… | Authority arrives and blesses the workers; the field is ordered by reverence. |
| (5) Then said Boaz… Whose damsel is this? | Attention notices the new identity moving within the field. |
| (6) It is the Moabitish damsel… | Her story is named: return, loyalty, and outsider status. |
| (7) She said, I pray you… and she came… | She requests lawful gleaning; endurance quietly proves sincerity. |
| (8) Then said Boaz… Go not to glean in another field… | Protection is offered: stay within this covering and do not drift. |
| (9) Have I not charged the young men… | Boundaries are set against harm; access is granted without fear. |
| (10) Then she fell on her face… | Humility receives favor with surprise. |
| (11) It hath fully been shewed me… | Loyalty is recognized as the true identity behind the outsider. |
| (12) The LORD recompense thy work… | Blessing is spoken: refuge is found under divine covering. |
| (13) Let me find favour… | Favor is received as comfort and belonging. |
| (14) At mealtime come thou hither… | Provision becomes personal; inclusion replaces distance. |
| (15) Let her glean even among the sheaves… | Grace exceeds minimum law; abundance is quietly arranged. |
| (16) Let fall also some… and rebuke her not. | Intentional provision is released; shame is forbidden. |
| (17) So she gleaned… and beat out… | Work gathers real substance; provision becomes measurable. |
| (18) And she took it up… and her mother in law saw… | Return brings visible provision home; evidence replaces despair. |
| (19) Where hast thou gleaned to day? | Naomi’s emptiness begins to question again—where did favor appear? |
| (20) Blessed be he… who hath not left off his kindness… | Naomi recognizes covenant-kindness operating through lawful means. |
| (21) He said unto me… keep fast by my young men… | Ruth reports the instruction: remain within protection until harvest ends. |
| (22) It is good… that they meet thee not… | Safety is confirmed; drift is discouraged. |
| (23) So she kept fast… unto the end… and dwelt with her mother in law. | Steady faithfulness continues through the season; provision becomes a pattern. |
