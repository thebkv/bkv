# Ruth 03 — VBV

* [Ruth 3 — The Threshingfloor Request](VBV/08_RUT/08_RUT_03_VBV.md)

## Summary
A lawful request is brought in humility and courage, integrity is protected, and redemption is positioned—waiting for public completion rather than private force.

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| (1) My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee… | Naomi seeks stable covering for Ruth—rest through lawful belonging. |
| (2) And now is not Boaz… winnoweth barley to night… | The moment is named: separation and sorting—an appointed time for decision. |
| (3) Wash thyself… anoint thee… | Prepare with dignity; come as one ready for a new standing. |
| (4) When he lieth down… mark the place… | Approach with discernment—order matters in vulnerable moments. |
| (5) All that thou sayest… I will do. | Ruth yields with trust; instruction is received. |
| (6) And she went down… and did… | Action follows counsel; the request is not merely felt but enacted. |
| (7) When Boaz had eaten… his heart was merry… | The day’s labor concludes; readiness for rest creates a quiet opening. |
| (8) And it came to pass at midnight… | A hidden hour reveals what is truly sought. |
| (9) Who art thou?… spread therefore thy skirt… | Ruth identifies herself and asks for covering—redeemership requested, not demanded. |
| (10) Blessed be thou… | Boaz recognizes covenant-virtue: loyalty over opportunism. |
| (11) Fear not… I will do to thee all… | Assurance is given; the request is honored with intent. |
| (12) Howbeit there is a kinsman nearer… | Lawful order is respected; zeal does not override right process. |
| (13) Tarry this night… if he will not… then will I… | Rest is commanded; outcome will be settled by proper sequence. |
| (14) Let it not be known… | Integrity is protected; the matter is kept from gossip-driven distortion. |
| (15) Bring the vail… he measured… | Provision is given as a pledge; care accompanies process. |
| (16) Who art thou, my daughter?… | Naomi seeks the report: has the request been received? |
| (17) These six measures… | Evidence of favor is presented; emptiness is being reversed. |
| (18) Sit still… the man will not be in rest… | Wait in trust; lawful completion will come without delay. |
