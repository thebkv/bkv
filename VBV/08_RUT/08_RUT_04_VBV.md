# Ruth 04 — VBV

* [Ruth 4 — Redemption Completed and Line Secured](VBV/08_RUT/08_RUT_04_VBV.md)

## Summary
Redemption is settled in public order: the nearer claim yields, the true redeemer accepts the full cost, and emptiness turns to inheritance as the line is secured.

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| (1) Then went Boaz up to the gate… | The matter moves to the place of witness—public truth, not private pressure. |
| (2) And he took ten men… | Completion is established with lawful witnesses. |
| (3) Naomi… selleth a parcel of land… | The case is stated plainly: inheritance is at stake. |
| (4) I thought to advertise thee… | The nearer claim is offered first; order is honored. |
| (5) What day thou buyest… thou must buy it also of Ruth… | The full cost is named: redemption includes the vulnerable and the name. |
| (6) I cannot redeem it… | The nearer claim withdraws when it would disrupt self-interest. |
| (7) Now this was the manner… | Transfer is formalized; the right is yielded openly. |
| (8) So the kinsman said… Buy it… | The claim steps back; the path clears. |
| (9) And Boaz said unto the elders… | Boaz declares the redemption in the light; ownership and responsibility accepted. |
| (10) Moreover Ruth… have I purchased to be my wife… | Redemption includes covenant union and the raising of the name. |
| (11) We are witnesses… | Community blesses the union as a rebuilding of the house. |
| (12) Let thy house be like… Perez… | The blessing ties the outcome to prior redemption patterns. |
| (13) So Boaz took Ruth… and she bare a son. | Fruit follows lawful union; life rises from restored order. |
| (14) Blessed be the LORD… that his name may be famous… | Naomi’s emptiness is answered; a redeemer-name is celebrated. |
| (15) And he shall be unto thee a restorer… | The child becomes a sign of restored future—life-strength renewed. |
| (16) And Naomi took the child… | Fullness returns into her arms; sorrow is re-housed. |
| (17) There is a son born to Naomi… Obed… | Identity is publicly rewritten; the line is named. |
| (18) Now these are the generations of Pharez… | The story widens into lineage—meaning carries forward. |
| (19) Hezron begat Ram… | Continuity is traced. |
| (20) And Ram begat Amminadab… | Continuity is traced. |
| (21) And Salmon begat Boaz… | Continuity is traced. |
| (22) And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David. | The redeemed line lands in kingship—future authority is seeded. |
