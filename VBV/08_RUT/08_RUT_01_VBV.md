# Ruth 01 — VBV

* [Ruth 1 — Return, Loss, and Loyal Attachment](VBV/08_RUT/08_RUT_01_VBV.md)

## Summary
Loss empties the old life, a turning back is offered, and loyal attachment chooses covenant direction over comfort—beginning a return that is inward before it is outward.

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| (1) Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled… | In a season of unstable governance, pressure produces scarcity. |
| (2) And the name of the man was Elimelech… | Identity and household relocate under strain, seeking relief outside inherited ground. |
| (3) And Elimelech… died; and she was left… | The former covering collapses; the household enters exposed survival. |
| (4) And they took them wives… | New bonds form in exile; life continues inside reduced conditions. |
| (5) And Mahlon and Chilion died also… | Remaining supports fail; emptiness becomes complete. |
| (6) Then she arose… to return… | Awareness turns back when provision is heard to be restored at the source. |
| (7) Wherefore she went forth… | Departure from exile begins; movement starts before resolution is visible. |
| (8) And Naomi said… Go, return each… | Release is offered; attachment is not demanded. |
| (9) The LORD grant you… and they lifted up their voice… | A blessing is spoken; grief surfaces as bonds face separation. |
| (10) Surely we will return with thee… | Initial loyalty answers the invitation to return. |
| (11) Turn again, my daughters… | Practical limits are named; false hope is removed. |
| (12) Turn again… I am too old… | No new natural support is promised; the future cannot be secured by old methods. |
| (13) Nay, my daughters… | The pain is acknowledged; bitterness interprets the pressure as personal. |
| (14) And Orpah kissed… but Ruth clave… | One returns to the familiar; one binds herself to the covenant path. |
| (15) Behold, thy sister… | The pull of the old household is presented as reasonable. |
| (16) And Ruth said, Intreat me not… | Loyal attachment refuses separation; identity chooses shared direction. |
| (17) Where thou diest… | Commitment is sealed beyond convenience; covenant is accepted as final. |
| (18) When she saw… she left speaking… | Resistance ends when loyalty proves stable. |
| (19) So they two went… | Return continues together; identity re-enters its former territory. |
| (20) Call me not Naomi… call me Mara… | The inner state names itself by pain; sweetness feels false under loss. |
| (21) I went out full… | The story is interpreted through emptiness; return feels like defeat. |
| (22) So Naomi returned… in the beginning of barley harvest. | Return lands in a season of provision; timing quietly signals a new start. |
