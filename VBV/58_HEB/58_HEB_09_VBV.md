# Hebrews 9 — VBV

* [Hebrews 9 — From Regulated Distance to Completed Access](VBV/58_HEB/58_HEB_09_VBV.md)

## Summary
Former worship ordered approach through repeated regulation and distance. Christ enters once, secures eternal redemption, cleanses conscience, and establishes permanent access through a completed offering.

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service… | The former covenant structured worship through regulated practice and sacred space. |
| For there was a tabernacle made… | Sacred zones are defined by increasing restriction and separation. |
| And after the second veil… | Access is layered, delayed, and mediated. |
| Which had the golden censer… | Sacred objects symbolize controlled proximity to presence. |
| And over it the cherubims… | Glory is acknowledged but shielded from direct approach. |
| Now when these things were thus ordained… | Repetition governs approach; access remains incomplete. |
| But into the second went the high priest alone… | Full entry is rare, delayed, and representative. |
| Which the Holy Ghost this signifying… | The structure itself testifies that access is not yet open. |
| Which was a figure for the time then present… | The system functions as provisional, not final. |
| Which stood only in meats and drinks… | External regulation governs the body, not the conscience. |
| But Christ being come an high priest… | A new mediator enters with completed authority. |
| Neither by the blood of goats and calves… | Redemption is secured through a single, sufficient act. |
| For if the blood of bulls… | External cleansing has limited scope. |
| How much more shall the blood of Christ… | Inner cleansing restores conscience for living service. |
| And for this cause he is the mediator… | A new covenant is established through completed release. |
| For where a testament is… | Inheritance requires confirmed transfer. |
| For a testament is of force after men are dead… | Completion, not repetition, establishes permanence. |
| Whereupon neither the first testament… | Covenant inauguration requires life offered. |
| Moreover he sprinkled with blood… | All things were stabilized through life-symbol transfer. |
| And almost all things are by the law purged… | Release requires life to resolve loss. |
| It was therefore necessary… | Earthly patterns mirror a greater reality. |
| But Christ entered into heaven itself… | Presence is now direct, not symbolic. |
| Nor yet that he should offer himself often… | Repetition would reintroduce instability. |
| But now once in the end of the world… | A decisive act resolves sin across time. |
| And as it is appointed unto men once to die… | Judgment follows finality, not cycle. |
| So Christ was once offered… | One offering completes the work. |
| And unto them that look for him… | Expectation shifts from sacrifice to fulfillment. |
