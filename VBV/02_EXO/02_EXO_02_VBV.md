# Exodus 2 — VBV

* [Exodus 2 — Preservation Through Hiddenness](VBV/02_EXO/02_EXO_02_VBV.md)

## Summary
Life is preserved through concealment, displacement, and unintended mercy. Deliverance begins quietly, outside formal power, and matures through exile before re-engagement.

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| And there went a man of the house of Levi… | A threatened lineage initiates concealment. |
| And the woman conceived, and bare a son… | Life emerges under active danger. |
| And when she saw him that he was a goodly child… | Value is recognized before viability is assured. |
| And she hid him three months. | Preservation requires hiddenness. |
| And when she could not longer hide him… | Concealment reaches its limit. |
| She took for him an ark of bulrushes… | Protection is transferred to a fragile vessel. |
| And laid it in the flags by the river’s brink. | Exposure occurs within constrained safety. |
| And his sister stood afar off… | Watchful presence accompanies release. |
| And the daughter of Pharaoh came down… | Authority encounters vulnerability. |
| And she had compassion on him… | Mercy interrupts policy. |
| Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter… | Advocacy emerges from proximity. |
| Take this child away, and nurse it for me… | Care is restored through unexpected channels. |
| And the child grew, and she brought him… | Preservation transitions to placement. |
| And she called his name Moses… | Identity is named by displacement. |
| And it came to pass in those days… | Awareness of injustice awakens. |
| And he slew the Egyptian… | Premature action attempts resolution. |
| And he hid him in the sand. | Force is followed by concealment. |
| And when Pharaoh heard this thing… | Authority responds with threat. |
| But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh… | Withdrawal preserves future purpose. |
| And he sat down by a well. | Stillness follows rupture. |
| Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters… | Provision appears outside former identity. |
| And Moses was content to dwell with the man… | Stability replaces urgency. |
| And she bare him a son… | New life forms in exile. |
| For he said, I have been a stranger… | Identity is reshaped through displacement. |
| And it came to pass… the king of Egypt died… | Oppressive authority transitions. |
| And the children of Israel sighed… | Long pressure surfaces as cry. |
| And God heard their groaning… | Distress is registered. |
| And God remembered his covenant… | Continuity is re-activated. |
| And God looked upon the children of Israel… | Attention is focused. |
| And God had respect unto them. | Readiness for intervention is established. |
