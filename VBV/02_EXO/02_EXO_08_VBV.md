# Exodus 8 — VBV

* [Exodus 8 — Authority Pressed, Imitation Exhausted, Boundaries Exposed](VBV/02_EXO/02_EXO_08_VBV.md)

## Summary
Authority escalates through repeated confrontation. Counterfeit power reaches its limit, compromise is attempted, boundaries are clarified, and distinction between systems is formally revealed. Resistance shifts from imitation to negotiation.

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh… | Instruction initiates renewed confrontation. |
| Let my people go, that they may serve me. | Release is framed as rightful service, not escape. |
| If thou refuse to let them go… | Consequences are conditioned on continued resistance. |
| I will smite all thy borders with frogs. | Pressure expands beyond symbols into daily life. |
| The river shall bring forth frogs abundantly… | What sustained life becomes a source of disruption. |
| Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron… | Resistance yields to temporary appeal under pressure. |
| Entreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs… | Relief is requested without yielding authority. |
| Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me… | Timing control is offered to expose intent. |
| And he said, Tomorrow. | Delay is chosen despite available resolution. |
| The frogs died out of the houses… | Relief arrives precisely as declared. |
| They gathered them together upon heaps… | The residue of judgment remains visible. |
| But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite… | Temporary relief weakens resolve. |
| He hardened his heart… | Resistance reasserts once pressure lifts. |
| And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thy rod… | Authority proceeds without negotiation. |
| Smite the dust of the land… | Pressure intensifies at the foundational level. |
| It became lice in man, and in beast. | Irritation replaces spectacle; endurance is tested. |
| The magicians did so… but they could not. | Imitation reaches its limit. |
| This is the finger of God. | True authority is verbally acknowledged. |
| Pharaoh’s heart was hardened… | Recognition does not equal submission. |
| And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early… | Persistence is required despite repeated refusal. |
| I will send swarms of flies… | Pressure becomes selective and invasive. |
| I will put a division between my people and thy people. | Distinction between systems is formally established. |
| Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron… | Negotiation replaces outright denial. |
| Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. | Compromise is proposed within control. |
| It is not meet so to do… | Improper alignment is refused. |
| We will go three days’ journey… | Separation is non-negotiable. |
| I will let you go… only ye shall not go very far away. | Partial release is offered with retained leverage. |
| Entreat for me. | Authority is still externally requested. |
| Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated… | Intercession proceeds despite instability. |
| The LORD did according to the word of Moses… | Authority responds consistently to alignment. |
| There remained not one fly. | Resolution is complete when enacted. |
| Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also… | Resistance persists even after repeated evidence. |
