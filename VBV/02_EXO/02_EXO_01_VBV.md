# Exodus 1 — VBV

* [Exodus 1 — Growth Under Pressure](VBV/02_EXO/02_EXO_01_VBV.md)

## Summary
A growing people multiply under blessing, are redefined as a threat, subjected to oppression, and yet continue to increase. Pressure intensifies resistance, but does not halt expansion.

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| Now these are the names of the children of Israel… | Identity is preserved through named continuity. |
| Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah… | Lineage establishes collective presence. |
| And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob… | A defined community is established. |
| And Joseph died, and all his brethren… | Generational transition occurs. |
| And the children of Israel were fruitful… | Increase accelerates beyond expectation. |
| And the land was filled with them. | Expansion becomes visible and undeniable. |
| Now there arose up a new king over Egypt… | Authority emerges without shared memory. |
| Which knew not Joseph. | Prior favor is disregarded. |
| And he said unto his people… | Fear reframes growth as threat. |
| Come on, let us deal wisely with them… | Control is justified as prudence. |
| Therefore they did set over them taskmasters… | Oppression is instituted as management. |
| But the more they afflicted them… | Pressure fails to restrict growth. |
| And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. | Hostility increases with expansion. |
| And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour… | Labor is intensified to suppress vitality. |
| And they made their lives bitter… | Existence is burdened to weaken identity. |
| And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives… | Control extends to generative boundaries. |
| When ye do the office of a midwife… | Life at inception is targeted. |
| But the midwives feared God… | Higher allegiance overrides command. |
| Therefore God dealt well with the midwives… | Alignment preserves life. |
| And the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. | Growth continues despite constraint. |
| And Pharaoh charged all his people… | Authority escalates strategy. |
| Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river… | Suppression turns openly destructive. |
| And every daughter ye shall save alive. | Survival is permitted selectively. |
