# Exodus 6 — VBV

* [Exodus 6 — Identity Reasserted and Authority Reframed](VBV/02_EXO/02_EXO_06_VBV.md)

## Summary
Divine identity is reasserted, covenant memory is restored, and delegated authority is reframed. The gap between promise and experience is acknowledged, but the mission is stabilized by revelation rather than response.

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| Then the LORD said unto Moses… | Divine assurance reframes resistance as temporary and controlled. |
| I am the LORD… | Identity is declared as the foundation of authority. |
| I appeared unto Abraham… | Covenant continuity is reaffirmed across generations. |
| But by my name JEHOVAH was I not known… | Deeper revelation is introduced through present action. |
| I have also established my covenant… | Promise is restated as active and binding. |
| I have heard the groaning… | Suffering is acknowledged as known, not ignored. |
| Wherefore say… I will bring you out… | Liberation is declared as deliberate intent. |
| I will redeem you with a stretched out arm… | Power is promised as purposeful intervention. |
| I will take you to me for a people… | Relationship is restored as the goal of deliverance. |
| I will bring you in unto the land… | Future settlement is named despite present bondage. |
| And Moses spake… but they hearkened not… | Discouragement blocks reception despite truth. |
| And the LORD spake unto Moses… | Commission continues independent of response. |
| See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh… | Authority is redefined functionally, not personally. |
| Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet… | Delegated roles are structured for execution. |
| These be the heads of their fathers’ houses… | Lineage is recorded to anchor authority in history. |
| This is that Moses and Aaron… | Identity is fixed and confirmed. |
| According to their armies… | Order is emphasized over chaos. |
| And it came to pass… | The call is reiterated under pressure. |
