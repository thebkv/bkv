# Exodus 9 — VBV

* [Exodus 9 — Distinction Intensified and Responsibility Exposed](VBV/02_EXO/02_EXO_09_VBV.md)

## Summary
Judgment escalates with precision. Distinction between systems is sharpened, responsibility is transferred through warning, selective obedience emerges, and resistance hardens through self-protection. Power is no longer merely displayed; it now requires decision.

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh… | Authority advances with renewed instruction. |
| Let my people go, that they may serve me. | Release remains framed as rightful service. |
| If thou refuse to let them go… | Continued resistance triggers escalation. |
| Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle… | Judgment targets economic and sustaining structures. |
| The LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and Egypt. | Distinction is applied materially and visibly. |
| And the LORD appointed a set time… | Judgment is scheduled, not impulsive. |
| And all the cattle of Egypt died… | Systemic loss is permitted within defined bounds. |
| But of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. | Preservation confirms distinction. |
| Pharaoh sent, and behold… | Verification is sought. |
| Yet the heart of Pharaoh was hardened… | Evidence does not override self-protection. |
| And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron… | Authority escalates beyond economic loss. |
| Take to you handfuls of ashes… | Residue of labor becomes instrument of judgment. |
| It shall become small dust… | What is dispersed becomes unavoidable. |
| And it became a boil breaking forth… | Pressure turns bodily and personal. |
| The magicians could not stand… | Counter-authority collapses under strain. |
| And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh… | Resistance becomes internally fixed. |
| And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early… | Warning precedes intensified judgment. |
| Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle… | Mercy is offered through instruction. |
| He that feared the word of the LORD… | Individual response becomes decisive. |
| He made his servants and his cattle flee… | Partial obedience emerges within the system. |
| And he that regarded not the word… | Neglect is allowed to bear consequence. |
| And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand… | Authority executes without hesitation. |
| There was hail, and fire mingled with the hail… | Judgment becomes overwhelming yet controlled. |
| The hail smote throughout all the land… | Comprehensive disruption is permitted. |
| Only in the land of Goshen… | Protection remains consistent. |
| Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron… | Confession replaces defiance momentarily. |
| I have sinned this time… | Acknowledgment is voiced without transformation. |
| Entreat the LORD… | Relief is requested again without surrender. |
| As soon as I am gone out of the city… | Authority acts independently of location. |
| But as for thee… I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD… | Motive is accurately diagnosed. |
| The flax and the barley was smitten… | Loss is specific and measurable. |
| But the wheat and the rie were not smitten… | Judgment remains restrained and timed. |
| And Moses went out… and the thunder and hail ceased… | Relief follows intercession precisely. |
| And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail… | Relief triggers reversal again. |
| He sinned yet more, and hardened his heart… | Resistance deepens through pattern. |
| And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened… | The condition stabilizes against correction. |
