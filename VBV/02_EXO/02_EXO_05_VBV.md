# Exodus 5 — VBV

* [Exodus 5 — Resistance Intensifies Under Demand](VBV/02_EXO/02_EXO_05_VBV.md)

Summary:
Delegated authority confronts entrenched power, resulting in intensified resistance. Burden increases, morale collapses, leadership is blamed, and the limits of human authority are exposed. The call remains valid, but its cost is revealed.

| 5:1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness. | Commissioned authority delivers a direct demand for release grounded in divine claim rather than negotiation. |
| 5:2 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go. | Ruling power rejects authority by denying recognition, framing obedience as unnecessary. |
| 5:3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee… lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. | Authority is reiterated, now framed as necessary alignment to avoid consequence. |
| 5:4–5 And the king of Egypt said… Wherefore do ye… let the people from their works?… ye make them rest from their burdens. | Power reframes obedience as disruption and portrays liberation as irresponsibility. |
| 5:6–9 And Pharaoh commanded… Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick… | Threatened authority responds by increasing burden to suppress hope and control morale. |
| 5:10–11 And the taskmasters… said… Let there be no straw given you… | Oppression is operationalized and communicated as policy, not punishment. |
| 5:12 And the people were scattered abroad… to gather stubble instead of straw. | Survival effort replaces productive work under intensified constraint. |
| 5:13 And the taskmasters hasted them… | Pressure is enforced without adjustment to expectation. |
| 5:14 And the officers… were beaten… | Responsibility is shifted downward; intermediaries absorb punishment. |
| 5:15–16 And the officers… cried unto Pharaoh… Wherefore dealest thou thus… | Appeal is made to power for fairness, but not for freedom. |
| 5:17–18 And he said, Ye are idle… Go therefore now, and work… | Power doubles down, redefining obedience as laziness and reinforcing burden. |
| 5:19 And the officers… did see that they were in evil case… | Reality of worsening condition becomes undeniable. |
| 5:20–21 And they met Moses and Aaron… The LORD look upon you, and judge… | Pressure fractures unity; deliverers are blamed for increased suffering. |
| 5:22 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said… why is it that thou hast sent me? | Leadership confronts dissonance between promise and outcome. |
| 5:23 For since I came… neither hast thou delivered thy people at all. | The chapter ends with unresolved tension and unanswered accusation. |
