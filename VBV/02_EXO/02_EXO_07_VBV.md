# Exodus 7 — VBV

* [Exodus 7 — Authority Contested and Power Displayed](VBV/02_EXO/02_EXO_07_VBV.md)

## Summary
Delegated authority confronts hardened power. Signs are introduced as verification, imitation is permitted, resistance intensifies, and the conflict of authority is formally engaged.

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| And the LORD said unto Moses… | Authority is reaffirmed before confrontation. |
| I have made thee a god to Pharaoh… | Functional authority is established over the ruler. |
| Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet… | Communication flows through appointed structure. |
| Thou shalt speak all that I command… | Instruction governs action precisely. |
| Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you… | Resistance is anticipated, not unexpected. |
| I will lay my hand upon Egypt… | Power is asserted as controlled intervention. |
| And the Egyptians shall know… | Recognition of authority is the stated outcome. |
| And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded… | Obedience proceeds without alteration. |
| Moses was fourscore years old… | Human limitation is noted without disqualification. |
| When Pharaoh shall speak unto you… | Challenge is expected to provoke verification. |
| Cast down thy rod… | Authority is demonstrated through action. |
| And it became a serpent… | Power is made visible. |
| Then Pharaoh also called the wise men… | Counter-authority is summoned. |
| They did in like manner… | Imitation is permitted within limits. |
| But Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods… | True authority absorbs false power. |
| And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart… | Resistance persists despite evidence. |
| And the LORD spake unto Moses… | Escalation is prepared. |
| Pharaoh’s heart is hardened… | The condition is diagnosed without surprise. |
| And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. | Survival labor replaces submission. Workarounds emerge under sustained pressure. |
| And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river. | Judgment is sustained long enough to test endurance rather than provoke immediate surrender. |
