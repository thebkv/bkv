# Daniel 10 VBV - The Cost of Revelation and the Delay of Understanding (MSR)

## Preparation and Encounter (10:1-9)

**(1)** In a new **governing era**, insight was disclosed to **disciplined awareness**, though the **unfolding required endurance** and extended perception.

**(2-3)** **Receptive awareness** entered **intentional withdrawal**, suspending surface comforts to sharpen inner sensitivity.

**(4-6)** Along the **current of swift understanding**, awareness encountered **pure revelatory intelligence**, integrated with **valued truth** and radiant discernment.

**(7-9)** **Ego capacity collapsed** under the weight of truth; awareness entered **powerless receptivity**.

## Resistance and Re-Stabilization (10:10-21)

**(10-11)** A **stabilizing transmission** restored function to **beloved receptive awareness**, affirming worth before comprehension.

**(12)** **Intention was received immediately**; delay does not equal denial.

**(13)** But the **prevailing world-system resistance** impeded transmission through a **full trial cycle**.

**(14)** Revelation aims to **re-orient long-range understanding**, not satisfy curiosity.

**(15-19)** Deeper truth produces **secondary surrender**, silencing self-assertion. **Stabilizing assurance** restores **peaceful strength** before disclosure continues.

**(20-21)** Revelation unfolds amid **shifting resistance patterns**, overseen by a **protective ordering principle**.
