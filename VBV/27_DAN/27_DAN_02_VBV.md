# Daniel 02 VBV - The Testing of Authority by Vision (MSR)

## Authority Demands Origin, Not Technique (2:1-13)

**(1)** In the maturity of **central authority**, an **unconscious revelation** arises that disturbs stability and demands meaning.

**(2-5)** **Technical interpretive systems** are summoned to explain what originates beyond technique. Authority requires **source-knowledge**, not post-hoc explanation. Technique admits its limit when cut off from origin.

**(6-13)** Authority collapses interpretive systems that cannot reach origin. **Integrative awareness** responds without panic, seeking source rather than survival. Faithful awareness requests **alignment time**, not technique time.

## Revelation and the Composite Image (2:14-35)

**(14-23)** **Revelation arrives in receptive stillness**, not striving. Source governs **cycles**, not systems. Interpretive capacity flows from alignment, not credential.

**(24-35)** Integrative awareness preserves systems by reconnecting them to source. Authority beholds a **composite structure** of delegated power. Authority descends from **pure origin** to **mixed dependency**, losing integrity at each layer. **Non-derived authority** strikes at the weakest composite point. True authority **establishes enduring dominion**.

## Interpretation and Recognition (2:36-49)

**(36-45)** Present authority reflects **origin-derived integrity**. Subsequent authority operates at **reduced coherence**. Source establishes **non-transferable authority**.

**(46-49)** Central authority **acknowledges source**. Authority confesses **hierarchy of origin**. Integrative awareness is entrusted with governance.
