## Testing of Allegiance (1:1-21)  

**(1-2)** In a season of weakened inner rule, **dominant system authority** advances against **ordered inner orientation** and places it under pressure. **Source Authority** permits partial surrender of **sacred capacities of consciousness** into the **system of assimilation**, testing stewardship rather than destroying alignment.

**(3-4)** The system selects **high-capacity inner faculties** to be re-trained for service within its own identity framework.

**(5-7)** The system offers **identity nourishment** sourced from its own values to ensure dependency. Aligned faculties are **re-labeled** by the system in an attempt to redefine identity and allegiance.

**(8-9)** **Judgment aligned with God** establishes an inner resolve to refuse **system-defined identity intake**. Alignment with **Source** produces relational grace even within system authority.

**(10-13)** System agents fear outcomes; aligned discernment proposes a test rather than rebellion. A **complete testing interval** is proposed using **simple sustaining truth** instead of system excess.

**(14-16)** Alignment produces visible coherence superior to system nourishment. System accommodation follows proven integrity.

**(17)** **Source** grants **integrated insight**, with **symbolic perception** uniquely entrusted to aligned judgment.

**(18-20)** Aligned faculties surpass system-trained counterparts in wisdom and discernment.

**(21)** Aligned judgment **endures across regime changes**, outlasting systems.
