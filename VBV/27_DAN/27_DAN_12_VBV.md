# Daniel 12 VBV - Awakening, Endurance, and Sealed Time (MSR)

## Final Stress and Revelation (12:1-4)

**(1)** At the threshold, **protective ordering authority** asserts itself as the system enters a **maximum stress condition**. Deliverance occurs only for identities aligned with the **register of true coherence**.

**(2)** Dormant identities **reactivate**: some stabilize into **coherent continuity**, others are exposed as **fragmented and unsustainable**.

**(3)** **Aligned interpreters** become stable reference points, guiding others into coherence with enduring clarity.

**(4)** The pattern is **intentionally deferred**. Activity and data increase, but comprehension remains sealed until alignment occurs.

## The Endurance of the Aligned (12:5-13)

**(5-7)** Disruption is **limited and measured**. Fragmentation exhausts itself before resolution completes.

**(8-9)** Understanding is withheld not by secrecy, but by unreadiness.

**(10)** Stress clarifies identity. Alignment increases perception; distortion blinds itself.

**(11-12)** When continuous alignment is replaced by distorted substitutes, endurance becomes the measure of blessing.

**(13)** Maintain coherence. Identity resolves at its appointed integration point.
