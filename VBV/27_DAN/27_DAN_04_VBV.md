# Daniel 04 VBV - Authority Humbled and Restored (MSR)

## The Self-Praise and the Warning Vision (4:1-18)

**(1-3)** The **dominant ruling identity** addresses all internal systems and expressions within lived experience, declaring stability and order. The ruling self recognizes that transformation has been **done to it**, not produced by it. Ultimate authority is acknowledged as **transcendent, continuous, and superior** to personal power cycles.

**(4-7)** Ego-authority is **stable, comfortable, and self-satisfied**. Inner disturbance interrupts false peace. Lower interpretive systems **cannot diagnose structural ego failure**.

**(8-18)** **Faithful interpretive awareness** is finally consulted. The dream concerns **self-identity structure**. Ego-authority expands in reach and dominance. **Regulatory divine awareness** orders enforced deconstruction. Core identity is **preserved but constrained** for correction. A **complete corrective cycle** is required.

## Collapse and Restoration (4:19-37)

**(19-27)** Ego-authority is explicitly identified as the structure under judgment. Authority loses rational governance. The lesson: **authority is delegated, not owned**. Humility could shorten the corrective cycle.

**(28-33)** Ego self-congratulation reaches its peak. Collapse is **immediate**. Authority devolves into **instinctual consciousness**.

**(34-37)** **Re-orientation to Source** restores clarity. Right authority begins with recognition. Ego is not destroyed — it is **put in its place**.
