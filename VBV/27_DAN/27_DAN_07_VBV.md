# Daniel 07 VBV - The Inner Architecture of Worldly Authority (MSR)

## The Four Authority Systems (7:1-8)

**(1)** In the reign of **externalized authority**, Daniel receives **internal symbolic perception** while at rest; he records the **structural meaning** of what was shown.

**(2-3)** Competing **ideological forces** agitate the **collective unconscious**, producing **four distinct authority systems**, each unlike the others.

**(4-6)** Successive authority systems increase in **speed, reach, and abstraction**, trading nobility for efficiency and control.

**(7-8)** A **totalizing system of power** arises, subdivided into **multiple authority expressions**, from which emerges a **self-exalting interpretive authority** claiming superiority.

## The Timeless Evaluation (7:9-14)

**(9-12)** All provisional authorities are suspended as **timeless evaluative authority** assumes judgment; **records of meaning** are examined. Self-exalting authority collapses under **exposure**, while other systems persist briefly in reduced form.

**(13-14)** **True human authority**, aligned with higher perception, is granted **enduring dominion** not subject to decay or replacement.

## The Kingdom Transferred (7:15-28)

**(15-18)** Authority systems are temporary, but **aligned identity communities** inherit lasting order.

**(19-27)** Self-exalting authority oppresses alignment until **timeless judgment** intervenes, transferring authority permanently to the aligned.
