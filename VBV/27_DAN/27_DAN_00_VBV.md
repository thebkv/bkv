# Daniel — Architectural Overview (MSR)

Daniel is not primarily a book about future prediction.
It is a book about authority under pressure.

Using the Minimum Sufficient Role (MSR) method, Daniel reveals how inner authority is:
	•	Preserved under cultural assimilation (chapters 1–6)
	•	Revealed through symbolic vision (chapters 7–12)

Daniel himself functions as the stable interpretive faculty — the part of consciousness that remains aligned with Source while operating inside foreign systems.

Babylon represents externalized authority structures that demand conformity.
Food, names, images, laws, and timelines are all tests of allegiance.

The visions are not disconnected prophecies, but symbolic disclosures of how distorted authority rises, rules, fractures, and is ultimately judged by a higher order.

Daniel therefore acts as the architectural bridge between:
	•	historical testing (Kings / Exile)
	•	and apocalyptic unveiling (Revelation)

This book is essential for MSR readers because it teaches:

How truth remains coherent when power systems are not.
