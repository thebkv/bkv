# Daniel 05 VBV - Weighed Authority and the End of False Sovereignty (MSR)

## The Misuse of Sacred Capacity (5:1-9)

**(1)** **Inherited authority** stages a display of **self-celebration**, engaging in **discernment-loosening indulgence** before dependent structures.

**(2-4)** **Intoxicated authority** repurposes **sacred capacities** for **self-glorification**, dissolving reverence into display.

**(5-6)** **Objective evaluation** manifests visibly at the **boundary of perception**, interrupting illusion with clarity. **False authority collapses internally** when confronted with unmanageable truth.

**(7-9)** **Inherited authority** seeks **interpretation from systems that depend on it**, and finds none.

## The Verdict: Measured and Found Wanting (5:10-31)

**(10-12)** **Residual memory of right order** recalls **true discernment** when power fails.

**(13-17)** **Discernment** is summoned but **tempted with external validation**. **True discernment cannot be purchased**.

**(18-23)** **History of humbled authority** is rehearsed to expose **forgotten dependence**. **Unhumbled inheritance** is the central failure.

**(24-28)** **Authority is counted, measured, and found structurally lacking; coherence is withdrawn.**

**(29-31)** **False authority still rewards truth it cannot survive**. **Unviable authority ends immediately; governance transfers.**
