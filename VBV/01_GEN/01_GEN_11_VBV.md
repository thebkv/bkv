# Genesis 11 — VBV  
## False Unity and Restored Dispersion

**SUMMARY**  
Genesis 11 portrays the formation of unified identity without reference to Source Authority. Shared language and collective ambition produce a false coherence that resists dispersion and calling. Division of language restores movement, limits self-exaltation, and redirects development according to intended order.

| KJV | VBV |
|-----|-----|
| And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. | Human society operates with complete communicative unity and shared identity. |
| And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east. | Movement occurs away from prior orientation. |
| And they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. | Settlement replaces calling-driven movement. |
| And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick. | Collective action arises from internal consensus rather than instruction. |
| And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. | Manufactured substitutes replace given foundations. |
| And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower. | Identity is centralized through shared construction. |
| And let us make us a name. | Self-derived permanence becomes the goal. |
| Lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. | Dispersion is feared and resisted. |
| And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower. | Source Authority evaluates the human system from outside its own self-assessment. |
| And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one. | Unity is acknowledged as real but incomplete. |
| And they have all one language. | Shared communication enables unchecked consolidation. |
| And this they begin to do. | The project represents an initial phase of unbounded self-direction. |
| And now nothing will be restrained from them. | Capability expands without internal limits. |
| Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language. | Differentiation is introduced to interrupt false coherence. |
| That they may not understand one another’s speech. | Communication is fragmented to prevent total consolidation. |
| So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence. | Movement is restored through dispersion. |
| And they left off to build the city. | Centralized identity construction ceases. |
| Therefore is the name of it called Babel. | The system is defined by confusion rather than coherence. |
| Because the LORD did there confound the language. | Fragmentation is identified as corrective, not destructive. |
| And from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad. | Distribution realigns humanity with intended development. |
