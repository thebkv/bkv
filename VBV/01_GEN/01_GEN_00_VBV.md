# READING MODES

Every chapter can be heard in two faithful modes.

Believer Reading receives the passage as guidance and promise—what God is saying and doing for us as we learn trust and walk the path of salvation.

Disciple Reading receives the passage as training—what must be noticed, corrected, and practiced so life becomes aligned in real time.

Neither reading is “better.” They are different stances toward the same Word. VBV is written to preserve the disciple-message with minimum interference: the structure and movement of the chapter, verse by verse, without added teaching.
