# READING NOTES

Every chapter in Scripture can be heard in two faithful modes.

Believer Reading receives the passage as guidance and promise. It explains what God is saying and doing for us as we learn trust and walk the path of salvation.

Disciple Reading receives the passage as training. It explains what must be noticed, corrected, and practiced so life becomes aligned in real time.

Neither reading is “better.” They are different stances toward the same Word. VBV is written to preserve the disciple-message with minimum interference: the structure and movement of the chapter, verse by verse, without added teaching.

The Bible Key disciple message should be considered a study tool, maybe a bit like a concordance. BKV is a nickname (Bible Kely "Version"), but to be clear it is not actually a version.  In all cases, real Scripture is the only true source.

Believer Reading
	•	Receives the text as good news and guidance
	•	Centers trust, salvation, comfort, warning, promise
	•	Answers: “What is God saying and doing for me?”

Disciple Reading
	•	Receives the text as training and instruction
	•	Centers obedience, practice, attention, inner alignment, endurance
	•	Answers: “What is this requiring of me right now?”

Neither is better.
They’re simply different stances toward the same Word.



A believer may be moving toward salvation and stability.
A disciple is someone who has decided to engage deliberately—to submit attention, habits, and inner posture to formation.

That’s what the MSR work is capturing.
