# Genesis 13 — VBV

* [Genesis 13 — Clarity Through Separation](VBV/01_GEN/01_GEN_13_VBV.md)

## SUMMARY

Genesis 13 resolves tension created by partial attachment. As Abram and Lot’s shared prosperity generates conflict, separation becomes necessary for coherence. The chapter establishes that alignment clarifies only when competing claims are released, and that promise unfolds after voluntary relinquishment rather than through control or negotiation.

| KJV | VBV |
|-----|-----|
| And Abram went up out of Egypt. | Recovery follows misalignment without penalty. |
| He and his wife, and all that he had. | The aligned identity retains continuity through correction. |
| And Lot with him. | Partial attachment remains after initial restoration. |
| And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold. | Material increase persists independent of alignment clarity. |
| And he went on his journeys. | Movement resumes as orientation is re-established. |
| Unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning. | Return to original alignment reference point occurs. |
| Unto the place of the altar. | Source acknowledgment is restored. |
| And Abram called on the name of the LORD. | Dependence is re-affirmed after correction. |
| And Lot also had flocks, and herds, and tents. | Parallel prosperity exists within shared space. |
| And the land was not able to bear them. | The environment cannot sustain competing claims. |
| And there was a strife between the herdmen. | Conflict emerges from overcrowded alignment. |
| And Abram said unto Lot. | Initiative toward resolution is taken by the aligned identity. |
| Let there be no strife, I pray thee. | Peace is prioritized over advantage. |
| Is not the whole land before thee? | Freedom of choice is offered without coercion. |
| Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. | Separation is proposed as solution, not punishment. |
| If thou wilt take the left hand. | Control is surrendered voluntarily. |
| And Lot lifted up his eyes. | Choice is made by visible advantage. |
| And chose him all the plain of Jordan. | Selection is based on surface fertility. |
| And they separated themselves the one from the other. | Alignment clarifies through physical separation. |
| Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan. | The aligned identity remains within promise context. |
| And Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain. | Proximity to system complexity increases. |
| But the men of Sodom were wicked. | Environmental corruption is noted without immediate consequence. |
| And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated. | Promise expands only after release occurs. |
| Lift up now thine eyes. | Vision is invited following relinquishment. |
| For all the land which thou seest. | Scope of promise is enlarged. |
| To thee will I give it. | Inheritance is affirmed without competition. |
| And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth. | Multiplication is assured beyond visible scale. |
| Arise, walk through the land. | Engagement follows clarity, not control. |
| And Abram removed his tent. | Mobility remains central to alignment. |
| And built there an altar unto the LORD. | Alignment is sealed by acknowledgment of Source. |
