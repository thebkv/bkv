# Genesis 14 — VBV  
## Recovery of Alignment Through Decisive Action

### SUMMARY  
Genesis 14 depicts the restoration of order after fragmentation turns violent. Power-based unity collapses, drawing the innocent into conflict. Abram intervenes decisively without absorbing the corrupted systems he confronts. Alignment is confirmed by higher authority, and reward is refused to preserve source integrity.

|-----|-----|
| And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel… | Fragmented power structures consolidate into dominance-based alliances. |
| These made war with Bera king of Sodom… | Conflict emerges from unstable coalitions lacking shared alignment. |
| Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer… | Prolonged submission produces pressure without resolution. |
| And in the thirteenth year they rebelled. | Resistance arises when imposed order becomes intolerable. |
| And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer… | Dominant systems respond to rebellion with forceful reassertion. |
| And they smote the Rephaims… | Violence expands outward, destabilizing surrounding regions. |
| And the king of Sodom went out to battle… | Local authorities engage without sufficient strength or coherence. |
| And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah… | Collapse results in loss of provision and protection. |
| And they took Lot… | Those positioned near disorder are carried away by it. |
| And there came one that had escaped… | Awareness of loss reaches aligned judgment. |
| And when Abram heard… he armed his trained servants… | Aligned authority responds with measured, prepared action. |
| And he divided himself against them by night… | Strategy is applied to restore balance, not to dominate. |
| And he brought back all the goods… | What was taken is recovered without appropriation. |
| And also brought again his brother Lot… | Relationship and responsibility are restored. |
| And the king of Sodom went out to meet him… | Corrupted authority seeks to reassert claim after rescue. |
| And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine… | Higher-order authority appears, confirming alignment. |
| And he blessed him… | Right action is recognized by non-coercive authority. |
| And Abram gave him tithes of all. | Alignment acknowledges source through voluntary return. |
| And the king of Sodom said… Give me the persons… | Corrupted systems attempt to reclaim legitimacy through reward. |
| And Abram said… I will not take from a thread… | Identity refuses dependency on misaligned sources. |
| Lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich. | Source integrity is preserved by rejecting false credit. |
