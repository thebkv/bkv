# GENESIS 06 — MSR Verse-by-Verse (VBV)

## Corruption, Grief, and the Preservation of Alignment

### Genesis 6:1–2
> As human capacity and expression increased across lived experience, **Higher-order perceptive faculties** fixated on **lower identity expressions**, joining authority to desire rather than alignment.

### Genesis 6:3
> Source declares that **animating alignment** will not endlessly contend with misdirected identity; **a bounded interval** is set for correction and continuation.

### Genesis 6:4
> Dominant identity structures emerged—**amplified power without discernment**—producing influence, notoriety, and force absent inner alignment.

### Genesis 6:5
> Source perceives that **human intent** has become structurally misaligned—every internal narrative oriented toward fragmentation without interruption.

### Genesis 6:6–7
> Source experiences **relational grief**—not error, but sorrow at misused freedom. Source declares a **systemic reset**, removing corrupted structures to preserve the possibility of ordered life.

### Genesis 6:8
> One aligned identity **remains receptive** to Source alignment.

### Genesis 6:9
> Noah functions as **internally coherent judgment**, undivided across inherited patterns, operating in continuous alignment with Source.

### Genesis 6:11–12
> The entire system is structurally unstable, dominated by **force-based interaction** rather than order.

### Genesis 6:13
> Source declares that the **current pattern cannot continue** and must be dissolved with its supporting structures.

### Genesis 6:14–21
> Construct an **interior preservation structure**, sealed internally and externally against collapse. Preserve **viable patterns of life** within aligned containment.

### Genesis 6:22
> Aligned judgment executes instruction **without distortion or delay**.
