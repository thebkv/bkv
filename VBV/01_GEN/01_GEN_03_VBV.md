# Genesis 3 — VBV

* [Genesis 3 — Boundary Crossed, Order Strained](VBV/01_GEN/01_GEN_03_VBV.md)

SUMMARY

Genesis 3 records the crossing of a defined boundary and the resulting shift in human perception and relationship. Trust gives way to self-direction, openness to self-consciousness, and ease to strain. Life continues, but under altered conditions marked by limitation, distance, and increased effort.

| Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field. | A voice of subtle re-framing entered the ordered setting. |
| Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? | The boundary was questioned and recast as restriction. |
| Ye shall not surely die. | Consequence was minimized. |
| For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened. | Autonomy was offered as advantage. |
| And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food. | Evaluation shifted to personal assessment. |
| And she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat. | The boundary was crossed. |
| And the eyes of them both were opened. | Perception turned inward. |
| And they knew that they were naked. | Exposure replaced unguarded openness. |
| And they sewed fig leaves together. | Self-covering replaced trust. |
| And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden. | Relationship was encountered under fear. |
| And Adam and his wife hid themselves. | Distance entered relationship. |
| And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? | Awareness of separation was named. |
| And he said, I was afraid. | Fear entered perception. |
| And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me. | Responsibility was deflected. |
| And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me. | Blame displaced ownership. |
| Unto the serpent he said. | Consequence followed the breach. |
| Unto the woman he said. | Strain entered desire and relationship. |
| Unto Adam he said. | Work and effort became burdensome. |
| In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread. | Sustenance now required struggle. |
| For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. | Mortality became conscious and unavoidable. |
| And the LORD God made coats of skins. | Provision continued under new conditions. |
| Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden. | Access to the former state was restricted. |
| And he placed cherubims, and a flaming sword. | Unbounded return was prevented for preservation. |
