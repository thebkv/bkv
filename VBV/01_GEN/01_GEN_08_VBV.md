* [Genesis 8 — Recession of Chaos](VBV/01_GEN/01_GEN_08_VBV.md)

SUMMARY

Genesis 8 records the gradual withdrawal of chaos and the careful re-establishment of order. The chapter moves slowly from total saturation to grounded stability, emphasizing patience, testing, and restraint.

| And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; | Order returned to Noah and all that was with him, and the forces of chaos began to withdraw. |
| The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained; | The sources of overwhelming force were closed, and restraint was restored. |
| And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. | The waters receded steadily, and the saturation slowly diminished. |
| And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. | The ark came to rest upon elevated ground after the waters withdrew. |
| And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. | As the waters continued to recede, stable ground gradually reappeared. |
| And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: | After a period of waiting, Noah tested the conditions beyond the enclosure. |
| And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. | He released a raven, which found no resting place and continued moving. |
| Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; | He sent out a dove to test whether stability had returned. |
| But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark. | The dove found no place to settle and returned to the place of shelter. |
| And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; | After waiting, he tested again. |
| And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: | The dove returned bearing a sign that life and grounding were re-emerging. |
| And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more. | After further waiting, the dove did not return, indicating stability. |
| And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth. | The surface conditions fully cleared, and the ground was exposed. |
| And Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. | Noah observed that the ground had stabilized. |
| And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. | The earth became fully firm and reliable. |
| And God spake unto Noah, saying, | Direction was given to move forward. |
| Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. | Noah and all with him were released from containment. |
| Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh. | Life was invited to re-enter the open world. |
| And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. | Noah marked the transition with an act of acknowledgment and offering. |
| And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, | Relationship was re-established. |
| I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake. | The cycle of destruction was restrained. |
| While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease. | The rhythms of life were stabilized and secured. |
