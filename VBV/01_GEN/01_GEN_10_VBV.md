* [Genesis 10 — Ordered Dispersion](VBV/01_GEN/01_GEN_10_VBV.md)

SUMMARY

Genesis 10 records the structured spread of humanity after stabilization. Peoples are differentiated by lineage, territory, and language, forming the basic map of human distribution. The chapter presents expansion without judgment, establishing order through separation before the later emergence of conflict.

| Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. | These are the lines through which humanity expanded after the flood. |
| The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai… | Japheth’s descendants spread outward into distant regions and coastlands. |
| By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands. | Peoples settled into distinct territories according to their families. |
| And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. | Ham’s descendants formed strong regional centers. |
| And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. | A figure of concentrated power emerged within the spread of nations. |
| He was a mighty hunter before the LORD. | Dominance and ambition were openly recognized. |
| And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad. | Organized rule and centralized authority took shape. |
| And Mizraim begat Ludim… | Cultural and social groupings developed through lineage. |
| And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth. | Settled populations formed enduring identities. |
| These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations. | Ham’s line established structured societies with defined boundaries. |
| Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder. | Shem’s line is set apart for continuity across generations. |
| The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad… | Shem’s descendants carried forward ordered lineage. |
| These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. | Identity, language, and place were aligned. |
| These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations. | Humanity was distributed according to family lines. |
| And by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood. | The earth was populated through structured dispersion. |
