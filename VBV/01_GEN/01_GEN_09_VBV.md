# Genesis 9 — VBV

* [Genesis 9 — Boundaries After the Flood](VBV/01_GEN/01_GEN_09_VBV.md)

SUMMARY

Genesis 9 establishes the conditions under which life continues after the flood. Authority is clarified, limits are introduced, and the preservation of life is formally secured. A covenant is set not only with humanity but with all living things, marked by a sign intended to stabilize memory and prevent the return of total destruction.

|-----|-----|
| And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. | Life was authorized to expand again across the earth. |
| And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth. | Human authority over other life was established. |
| Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you. | Sustenance was permitted broadly. |
| But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. | A boundary was placed on consumption: life itself was not to be absorbed. |
| And surely your blood of your lives will I require. | Human life was placed under protection. |
| Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed. | Violence against human life was bounded with consequence. |
| For in the image of God made he man. | Human life was grounded in divine likeness. |
| And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth. | The mandate to increase was reaffirmed. |
| And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, | The covenant was addressed openly. |
| And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; | A binding promise was set with future generations. |
| And with every living creature that is with you. | The covenant extended to all life. |
| Neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood. | Total destruction would not be repeated. |
| This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you. | A sign was appointed to preserve remembrance. |
| I do set my bow in the cloud. | The bow was placed as a visible marker. |
| And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth. | The sign would recur under threatening conditions. |
| That the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. | The sign would restrain the return of chaos. |
| And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant. | The promise was affirmed. |
| And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth. | Humanity emerged through distinct lines. |
| And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard. | Life resumed ordinary work and cultivation. |
| And he drank of the wine, and was drunken. | Human weakness reappeared. |
| And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father. | Disorder entered through exposure without restraint. |
| And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders. | Restraint and covering were exercised. |
| And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. | Awareness returned and consequences followed. |
| And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be. | The outcome of disorder was named. |
| Blessed be the LORD God of Shem. | Alignment with order was acknowledged. |
| God shall enlarge Japheth. | Expansion was appointed within proper bounds. |
| And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. | Life continued under the established order. |
