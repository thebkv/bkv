# Genesis 15 — VBV  
## Alignment Confirmed by Promise, Not Performance

### SUMMARY  
Genesis 15 establishes covenantal assurance independent of action. After decisive intervention in Genesis 14, Abram is instructed to remain still. Fear is addressed, promise is clarified, and alignment is sealed by divine initiative alone. The chapter distinguishes inheritance by trust from possession by effort.

| KJV | VBV |
|-----|-----|
| After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision. | Alignment is addressed directly following decisive action. |
| Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward. | Protection and provision are sourced from Presence, not outcome. |
| And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me… | Inner concern surfaces despite prior obedience. |
| And, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. | Human reasoning attempts to resolve promise through existing structure. |
| This shall not be thine heir… | Inheritance is redirected away from system-generated solutions. |
| But he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. | Promise is rooted in origin, not arrangement. |
| Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars… | Perspective is expanded beyond measurable limits. |
| And Abram believed in the LORD. | Trust replaces calculation. |
| And he counted it to him for righteousness. | Alignment is established by reliance, not execution. |
| I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur… | Identity is grounded in prior extraction from false systems. |
| Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? | Assurance is requested, not as doubt, but as grounding. |
| Take me an heifer… and a ram… | Covenant structure is prepared, but not enacted by Abram. |
| And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram. | Human agency is suspended during covenant establishment. |
| And, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. | The weight of future consequence is revealed without demand. |
| Thy seed shall be a stranger in a land… | Delay and suffering are named as part of unfolding fulfillment. |
| But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again. | Fulfillment is timed beyond immediate resolution. |
| And it came to pass… a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp… | Divine authority alone passes through covenant terms. |
| In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram. | Promise is sealed without reciprocal obligation. |
