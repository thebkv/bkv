# Genesis 35 — VBV
## Restored Alignment Before Inheritance

SUMMARY

Genesis 35 records the return to prior alignment before forward movement is permitted. Jacob is called back to Bethel, the place of original encounter, where foreign attachments are removed, identity is reaffirmed, and blessing resumes through obedience rather than strategy. The chapter demonstrates that inheritance does not advance until unresolved contamination is addressed.

| And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel. | A return to the place of original alignment is commanded. |
| And make there an altar unto God. | Alignment is restored through deliberate reorientation toward Source. |
| Then Jacob said unto his household. | Leadership initiates internal correction before movement continues. |
| Put away the strange gods that are among you. | Foreign dependencies are identified and removed. |
| And be clean, and change your garments. | Inner reordering is marked by outward readiness. |
| And let us arise, and go up to Bethel. | Obedience replaces delay; alignment becomes active. |
| And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods. | Competing authorities are surrendered. |
| And Jacob hid them under the oak. | Contamination is buried, not negotiated with. |
| And they journeyed. | Movement resumes only after correction. |
| And the terror of God was upon the cities. | Protection accompanies restored alignment. |
| So Jacob came to Luz, which is Bethel. | The original point of encounter is re-entered. |
| And he built there an altar. | Alignment is re-established, not assumed. |
| And God appeared unto Jacob again. | Presence responds to obedience. |
| And blessed him. | Blessing resumes after correction. |
| And God said, Thy name is Jacob no more, but Israel. | Identity is reaffirmed, not newly assigned. |
| And God said unto him, I am God Almighty. | Source Authority is reasserted. |
| Be fruitful and multiply. | Inheritance proceeds from restored order. |
| And God went up from him. | The encounter completes its role. |
| And Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died. | Prior generation support structures conclude. |
| And God appeared unto Jacob again. | Alignment is confirmed before transition. |
| And Rachel died. | Loss accompanies transition without halting purpose. |
| And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave. | Memory is honored without arresting movement. |
| And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond. | Expansion resumes from corrected foundation. |
| And Reuben went and lay with Bilhah. | Disorder emerges when boundaries are crossed. |
| And Israel heard it. | Transgression is acknowledged without collapse. |
| And Isaac gave up the ghost. | Generational transfer completes. |
| And his sons buried him. | Succession proceeds in order. |
