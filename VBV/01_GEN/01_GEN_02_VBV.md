# Genesis 2 — VBV

* [Genesis 2 — Placement Within Order](VBV/01_GEN/01_GEN_02_VBV.md)

SUMMARY

Genesis 2 narrows the ordered framework of creation into a lived environment. Humanity is formed, placed, and given purpose within a defined setting. Provision is abundant, work is meaningful, and freedom exists alongside a clear boundary. Relationship is introduced as essential to human completeness, and unity is established without fear or shame.

| Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. | The ordered framework of existence was completed. |
| And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made. | Order reached a state of stability and coherence. |
| And God rested on the seventh day. | Rest marked completion rather than inactivity. |
| And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it. | Stability itself was set apart. |
| These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created. | The account turns from framework to setting. |
| And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground. | Humanity was shaped within material conditions. |
| And breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. | Life was animated by imparted breath. |
| And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden. | A specific environment was prepared. |
| And there he put the man whom he had formed. | Humanity was placed deliberately within it. |
| And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree. | Provision was made abundant and accessible. |
| The tree of life also in the midst of the garden. | Sustaining life stood at the center. |
| And the tree of knowledge of good and evil. | A point of discernment and limit was present. |
| And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden to dress it and to keep it. | Humanity was given meaningful responsibility. |
| And the LORD God commanded the man, saying. | A boundary was clearly stated. |
| Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat. | Freedom was broad and generous. |
| But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat. | One clear limit was established. |
| For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. | The boundary carried consequence. |
| And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone. | Solitude was identified as incomplete. |
| And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast. | Relationship was explored but not fulfilled. |
| But for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. | No suitable counterpart was found. |
| And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam. | A new formation process began. |
| And he took one of his ribs. | Shared substance was used. |
| And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman. | Complementary partner was formed. |
| And brought her unto the man. | Relationship was established. |
| Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother. | A new primary union was defined. |
| And they shall be one flesh. | Unity was formed through joining. |
| And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. | Openness existed without fear or self-consciousness. |
