# GENESIS 04 — MSR Verse-by-Verse (VBV)

## Divergence of Alignment and the First Fracture

### Genesis 4:1–2
> **Human consciousness** engages **experiential awareness**, producing two orientations: **self-generated effort** (**Cain**) and **responsive alignment** (**Abel**). One tends **derived reality**; the other attends **primary life**.

### Genesis 4:3–5
> Each orientation directs **attention** toward Source. **Responsive alignment** offers its **best and first**, while **self-generated effort** offers **derived results**. Alignment is recognized; output is not. **Resentment** emerges where comparison replaces correction.

### Genesis 4:6–7
> **Source** addresses **self-generated identity** with correction: alignment remains possible. **Unintegrated impulse** waits for consent, but **governance is still offered**. Fracture is not yet inevitable.

### Genesis 4:8
> **Self-generated identity**, rejecting correction, eliminates **responsive alignment** in an **unmediated inner space**. The fracture becomes internalized and irreversible.

### Genesis 4:9–12
> **Source** exposes the fracture. Suppressed alignment continues to testify. **Effort-based reality** loses stability, producing **restless identity** without grounding.

### Genesis 4:13–16
> **Fractured identity** fears dissolution. **Source** applies **constraint**, preserving life without restoring alignment. Exile becomes a **state of unrest**, not annihilation.

### Genesis 4:17
> **Fractured orientation** stabilizes itself through **systems**. The **city** externalizes order without alignment, naming continuity after self-extension.
