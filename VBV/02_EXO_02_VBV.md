# Exodus 4 — VBV

* [Exodus 4 — Authority Confirmed Through Resistance](VBV/02_EXO/02_EXO_04_VBV.md)

## Summary
Delegated authority is tested through objection, sign, confrontation, and costly alignment. Resistance persists, but the commission advances through provision, partnership, and decisive separation.

| KJV | VBV |
|---|---|
| And Moses answered and said… | Objection arises from anticipated disbelief. |
| But, behold, they will not believe me… | Authority is questioned before engagement. |
| And the LORD said unto him… | Validation is provided through concrete signs. |
| What is that in thine hand? | Existing tools are recontextualized. |
| And he said, A rod. | Ordinary authority is acknowledged. |
| And he cast it on the ground… | Control is surrendered. |
| And it became a serpent… | Power reveals latent danger. |
| Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail… | Authority requires direct confrontation. |
| And it became a rod in his hand. | Control is restored under instruction. |
| And the LORD said furthermore… | Additional confirmation is granted. |
| Put now thine hand into thy bosom… | Internal condition is exposed. |
| And his hand was leprous… | Corruption appears when unchecked. |
| And he put his hand into his bosom again… | Restoration follows obedience. |
| And it was turned again as his other flesh. | Wholeness is recoverable. |
| If they will not believe thee… | Resistance is anticipated as layered. |
| But Moses said unto the LORD… | Self-doubt persists despite evidence. |
| I am not eloquent… | Perceived limitation is presented. |
| Who hath made man’s mouth? | Source authority reframes capability. |
| Now therefore go… | Commission proceeds independent of comfort. |
| And Moses said… send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. | Reluctance reaches refusal. |
| And the anger of the LORD was kindled… | Delay carries consequence. |
| Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? | Partnership is assigned. |
| And thou shalt speak unto him… | Authority is shared, not revoked. |
| And thou shalt take this rod… | Commissioned instrument is retained. |
| And Moses went and returned… | Transition from encounter to obedience. |
| Let us go, we pray thee… | Permission is sought to disengage. |
| And the LORD said unto Moses… | Authorization is reaffirmed. |
| And Moses took his wife and his sons… | Identity and calling intersect. |
| And it came to pass by the way… | Crisis interrupts movement. |
| And the LORD met him, and sought to kill him. | Misalignment threatens mission. |
| Then Zipporah took a sharp stone… | Immediate corrective action occurs. |
| So he let him go… | Alignment restores passage. |
| And the LORD said to Aaron… | Support is mobilized. |
| And he went, and met him… | Partnership converges. |
| And Moses told Aaron all the words… | Commission is transferred faithfully. |
| And the people believed… | Authority is received. |
| And when they heard… | Recognition of intervention produces humility. |
| Then they bowed their heads and worshipped. | Alignment is acknowledged corporately. |
