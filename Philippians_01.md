# Philippians 1 — BKV Study  
## *Joy in Chains, Partnership in Grace, and the Single-Minded Life in Christ*

---

# **BKV–NR (Narrative Reading)**

1. Paul and Timothy, **servants** of Jesus Christ,  
   to all the **saints** in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi,  
   with the **overseers** and **servants**.

2. Grace to you, and peace,  
   from God our Father  
   and the Lord Jesus Christ.

---

## **Thanksgiving and Partnership**

3. I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,

4. Always in every prayer of mine for you all  
   making request with **joy**,

5. For your **partnership** in the good news  
   from the first day until now.

6. Being confident of this very thing,  
   that He who began a **good work** in you  
   will **complete** it  
   until the day of Jesus Christ.

7. It is right for me to think this of you all,  
   because I have you in my heart;  
   for both in my **chains**  
   and in my **defense**  
   and **confirmation** of the gospel,  
   you are all **partakers** with me of grace.

8. For God is my witness,  
   how I long after you all  
   with the **affection** of Jesus Christ.

---

## **Paul’s Prayer for Their Growth**

9. And this I pray,  
   that your **love** may abound  
   yet more and more,  
   in **knowledge** and all **discernment**,

10. That you may approve things that **excel**,  
    that you may be sincere and without offense  
    till the day of Christ,

11. Being filled with the **fruit of righteousness**,  
    which comes through Jesus Christ,  
    to the glory and praise of God.

---

## **Chains That Advance the Gospel**

12. But I want you to know, brethren,  
    that the things which happened unto me  
    have actually **advanced** the gospel;

13. So that my **chains** in Christ  
    have become well known  
    throughout the whole **praetorium**  
    and to everyone else.

14. And most of the brethren,  
    becoming confident in the Lord by my chains,  
    are much more bold  
    to speak the word without fear.

---

## **Mixed Motives — Same Christ**

15. Some indeed preach Christ  
    even out of **envy** and **rivalry**,  
    but others out of **goodwill**.

16. The former proclaim Christ  
    out of selfish ambition,  
    not sincerely,  
    thinking to add affliction to my chains.

17. But the latter out of love,  
    knowing that I am set  
    for the defense of the gospel.

18. What then?  
    Only this:  
    that in every way,  
    whether in pretense or in truth,  
    Christ is proclaimed,  
    and in this I rejoice,  
    yes, and will rejoice.

---

## **Life or Death — Christ is the Gain**

19. For I know that this will turn to my **deliverance**,  
    through your prayer  
    and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,

20. According to my earnest expectation and hope,  
    that I shall not be put to shame in anything,  
    but that with all boldness,  
    as always, so now also,  
    Christ will be magnified in my **body**,  
    whether by life or by death.

21. For to me,  
    **to live is Christ**,  
    and **to die is gain**.

22. But if I live in the flesh,  
    this will mean fruitful work for me;  
    yet I do not know what to choose.

23. For I am torn between the two,  
    having the desire to depart and be with Christ,  
    which is far better;

24. Nevertheless,  
    to remain in the flesh  
    is more needful for you.

25. And being confident of this,  
    I know that I will remain  
    and continue with you all  
    for your **progress** and **joy** in the faith,

26. That your rejoicing for me  
    may be more abundant in Jesus Christ  
    by my coming to you again.

---

## **Stand Worthy, Stand United**

27. Only conduct yourselves  
    in a manner **worthy** of the gospel of Christ,  
    so that whether I come and see you  
    or remain absent,  
    I may hear of your affairs:

    That you stand **firm** in one spirit,  
    with one mind  
    striving together  
    for the faith of the gospel;

28. And not in any way frightened by adversaries,  
    which is to them a sign of destruction,  
    but to you of salvation —  
    and that from God.

29. For to you it has been granted,  
    not only to believe on Him,  
    but also to **suffer** for His sake,

30. Having the same conflict  
    which you saw in me  
    and now hear to be in me.

# **BKV–DR (Deep Reading)**  
### *Poetic Alignment*

- Chains cannot bind joy.  
  They amplify it.

- The work God begins  
  God completes.  
  The disciple rests  
  in the finisher’s hands.

- Love grows  
  through knowledge,  
  and discernment shapes  
  what love approves.

- Envy cannot silence truth.  
  Rivalry cannot bury the gospel.  
  Christ is preached —  
  and Paul rejoices.

- Life and death  
  are both avenues  
  for Christ to be seen.

- Unity is not optional.  
  It is the posture  
  of the soul aligned  
  to a single center.

# **BKV Commentary**

### **1. Joy rooted in chains (vv. 12–14)**
Paul’s imprisonment becomes a catalyst for courage in others.  
Suffering does not hinder the gospel — it multiplies it.

### **2. Completion belongs to God (v. 6)**
This is the beating heart of Philippians:  
the work God begins, God finishes.

### **3. Love grows through discernment (v. 9)**
Love without discernment becomes sentimentality.  
Discernment without love becomes harshness.  
Paul wants both.

### **4. Mixed motives cannot stop Christ (vv. 15–18)**
Some preach from envy.  
Some from goodwill.  
Paul says: *Christ is preached. Let the heart rejoice.*

### **5. Life is Christ. Death is gain. (vv. 21–26)**
This is Christian paradox distilled:  
living means fruitful labor;  
dying means fuller union.

### **6. Unity is the witness (v. 27)**
Standing “with one mind” is not optional —  
it is the spiritual signature of maturity.

---

Philippians is the **letter of joy**,  
but Philippians 1 is the letter of **single-mindedness**.

Joy flows not from circumstances,  
but from a life that says:  

> **“To live is Christ.”**
